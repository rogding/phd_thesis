\chapter{Tips and Tricks}
\label{ap:tips_n_tricks}

Various tips and tricks I picked up over the years. 

\section{Working with (high-power) fibers}

Notes about fibered ODT setup.

Having a fiber inspection scope is super helpful\footnote{We recently acquired a F1MS200U from Fiber Instrument Sales and FS201-PM from Thorlabs.}

\section{Fiber injection lock slave lasers}

We found that using a fiber to couple injection light to a slave laser greatly increased the flexibility and ease-of-use of the slave laser. Fibering the injection light greatly shortens the path lengths compared to free-space injection locking. The fiber also enables easier optimization of the injection lock by using the light back-coupled through the fiber (exiting the ``input'' end) to optimize alignment to the diode.
