\chapter{Spectroscopy of \Sr{87} triplet Rydberg states}

We didn't set out to map out the triplet series of \Sr{87} Rydberg states, but when we first started looking for \Sr{87} \SLJ{3}{S}{} and \SLJ{3}{D}{} Rydberg states, we observed spectra which didn't line up with their predicted locations using the known quantum defects. 
It turns out that the hyperfine interaction in \Sr{87} is not negligible as the Rydberg states approach the \Srion{87}{+} hyperfine split core. 
We then rediscovered some papers from the 1980's which explained the shifted \SLJ{1}{S}{0} spectra in \Sr{87} by including the mixing of states with the same $F$. 
Previous work was accomplished mostly through the \nSLJ{5s5p}{1}{P}{1} state or from the metastable \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{2} states, our work appears to be the first measurements of the \Sr{87} hyperfine Rydberg states through the \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1} intermediate state.
