*** Need good intro to why study long-range interactions ***

The ability to produce cold and ultracold samples paved the way towards achievement of quantum degenerate gases of atoms which are ideal systems for studying quantum interactions. 
From the observation of BEC-BCS crossover, to xxx, and yyyy, most of the work so far has been based on short-range, isotropic contact interactions which require the atomic wave functions to overlap.
An ``easy'' way to extend these systems to more complexity and to study other phenomena ** D-wave super conductors? ** is to incorporate long-range interactions.
Now, the atoms no longer need to have an overlap to interact.



The three primary methods for incorporating long-range interactions in to quantum systems are currently being pursued:
\begin{description}
	\item[Polar molecules]
		The addition of an extra body to a single atom leads to a wealth of additional effects and complexity.
		Using bialkali as an example, heteronuclear molecules can have large (permanent) electric dipole moments \cite{Aymar2005.JCP.122.204302}. 
		The drawback is that the additional complexity typically makes it very difficult to produce ultracold and quantum degenerate samples.
		Steady progress has been made in the direct laser cooling of molecules \cite{Anderegg2018.NatPhys.14.890} as well as the recent producing of a degenerate Fermi gas of {{\tsup{40}\text{K}}{\tsup{87}\text{Rb}}} \cite{DeMarco2019.Science.363.853} produced by photoassociating ultracold atoms.
		These have the advantage of, ignoring chemical reactions for now, extremely long lifetimes. 
	\item[Magnetic atoms]
		Atoms themselves can have permanent dipole moments which can be used to study long-range interactions. 
		Quantum degeneracy has been reached with chromium \cite{Griesmaier2005.PRL.94.160401, Naylor2015.PRA.91.011603}, erbium \cite{Aikawa2012.PRL.108.210401, Aikawa2014.PRL.112.010404}, and dysprosium \cite{Lu2011.PRL.107.190401, Lu2012.PRL.108.215301}.
		Although simpler than molecules, their dipolar interactions are limited by the magnetic moment of atoms and typically requires tuning the short-range interactions to be weaker than the dipole interaction to observe their effects ** cite **.
		** There's also been a recent proposal for creating ultracold dysprosium atoms which exhibit an electric dipole moment in addition to the magnetic dipole moment \cite{Lepers2018.PRL.121.063201}. **
	\item[Rydberg states]
		Highly excited Rydberg states of atoms (and molecules) with principal quantum number $n \gg 1$ can also exhibit strong dipole interactions ** \cite{Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms} **. 
		** Many of the relevant scales scale with $n$. **
		The advantage of Rydberg atoms is that they permit the use of well-established techniques for producing quantum degenerate gases of atoms so that their interactions can be readily incorporated to existing setups. 
		** (Justify/clarify) The Rydberg-Rydberg interactions can also be very strong, much stronger than the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction in dysprosium. 
		The Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction also provide tunability where both the strength and sign of the interaction can be chosen based $n$.
		The major drawbacks are the sensitivities to stray electric fields due to the high-$n$ necessary for achieving strong interactions and Rydberg lifetimes due to both blackbody and Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. 
		Rydberg interactions can be (nearly) isotropic with $S$-states ($L = 0$) or anisotropic with $L > 0$ states ** add refs **. 
		Rydberg excitations have even been observed in solid state systems \cite{Kazimierczuk2014.Nature.514.343}. 
\end{description}

Our experiment pursues the latter by studying strontium Rydberg atoms.
Building on the expertise at Rice for producing ultracold and quantum degenerate strontium of the Killian lab and the creation, control, and detection of Rydberg atoms in the Dunning lab, our experiment melds the expertise of both groups. 

\section{Strontium Rydberg Atoms}

Compared to other work in ultracold and quantum degenerate Rydberg systems (primarily Rb and Cs with a growing interest in K), strontium offers some nice advantages over the alkalis. 

*********************


The work in this thesis was done with the alkaline earth metal atom strontium. 
Being a Group~II element, it has two valence electrons around a closed shell which gives it some nice properties regarding regarding laser cooling and spectroscopy:
-Ground-state has no/very weak magnetic moment - We don't have Feshbach resonances like the alkalis do but it's also relatively insensitive to magnetic fields.
-\Sr{87} has a large ({$I=\flatfrac{9}{2}$}) nuclear spin, making it interesting for ** INSERT REASONS **.
-The narrow intercombination line at \SI{689}{\nm} provides a really nice transition for performing spectroscopy and laser cooling.
Simon Stellmer has a nice writeup of the history of strontium in his PhD thesis \cite{Stellmer2013.PhD}.

\section{Rydberg Dressing}

Our experiment was originally built to pursue Rydberg dressing where atomic interactions are modified by incorporating strongly interacting Rydberg states \cite{Johnson2010.PRA.82.033412, Honer2010.PRL.105.160404}.
After work by our group \cite{Aman2016.PRA.93.043425, DeSalvo2016.PRA.93.022709, Gaul2016.PRL.116.243001}, the Pfau group \cite{Balewski2014.NJP.16.063012} ** CHECK IF CORRECT PFAU PAPER **, and the Porto group \cite{Goldschmidt2016.PRL.116.113001, Boulier2017.PRA.96.053409} found that Rydberg dressing was lossy, we moved on to other things.
