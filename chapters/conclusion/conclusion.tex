		Picture of the Rydberg apparatus taken on 2014/05/29 just before we started preparing to bake the vacuum system.
		We had just observed our first blue MOT the day before. 
		**I'm not sure why the $\SI{461}{\nm}$ beams appear pink; it's probably due to the camera's sensor saturating and bleeding in to the red sensor.**}
