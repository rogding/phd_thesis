\chapter{Spectroscopy of $\Sr{87}$ Triplet Rydberg States}

We didn't set out to map out the triplet series of $\Sr{87}$ Rydberg states, but when we first started looking for $\Sr{87}$ $\SLJ{3}{S}{}$ and $\SLJ{3}{D}{}$ Rydberg line, their positions didn't match predictions using the reported quantum defects and ionization energies. 
It turns out that the hyperfine interaction in $\Sr{87}$ is not negligible where the core electron couples to the $\Srion{87}{+}$ core with $I=9/2$.
As $n$ increases, the Rydberg states approach the $\Srion{87}{+}$ hyperfine split core. 
We then rediscovered some papers from the 1980's which explained the shifted $\SLJ{1}{S}{0}$ spectra in $\Sr{87}$ by including the mixing of states with the same $F$. 
Previous spectroscopic work was mostly through the $\nSLJ{5s5p}{1}{P}{1}$ state or from the metastable $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{2}$ states so our work appears to be the first measurements of the $\Sr{87}$ hyperfine Rydberg states through the $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ intermediate state. 

We measured $\Sr{87}$ hyperfine Rydberg spectra using a two-photon excitation through the intermediate $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ states and presented the work in \cite{Ding2018.PRA.98.042505}.
This thesis contains a bit of a reanalysis from my point of view but the results remain largely unchanged from the published paper. 
To save some space, the tables of measured \Sr{87} Rydberg energies are placed in the appendix (see \cref{tab:data-s-state,tab:data-d-state}).

\section{Ionization Limit of $\Sr{87}$}

The first indication that the Rydberg levels of $\Sr{87}$ were not as simple as for the bosonic isotopes was the reported ionization limit, $E_{\text{ion}}^{87} = \SI{45932.2861(10)}{\per\cm}$ \cite{Beigang1982.OC.42.19, Sansonetti2010.JPCRD.39.033103}, being well above those of the bosonic isotopes (see \cref{fig:Eion-mass-scaled} and \cref{tab:ionization_limits}). 
\begin{figure}[htbp]

		See \cref{ap:sr_data} for isotopic masses and ionization energies.}
\end{figure}
Mass-scaling the ionization energies of the bosonic isotopes suggests that the ionization energy for an assumed $I=0$ \Sr{87} atom should be $\SI{45932.1946+-0.0005}{\per\cm}$, about $\SI{2.74}{\GHz}$ below the reported ionization energy.

The source of this discrepancy is likely related to the hyperfine interaction in the ground state of \Srion{87}{+}. 
Since ground state \Srion{87}{+} has a rubidium-like structure with a single valence $s$ electron outside a filled {[Kr]} shell, the hyperfine interaction can be written as (see, e.g., \cite{Steck.QuantumAtomOptics})
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}	=	A_{\text{hfs}} \hat{\va{I}} \vdot \hat{\va{J}}
							=	A_{\text{hfs}} \hat{\va{I}} \vdot \hat{\va{S}}
\end{equation}
where $\va{J} = \va{L} + \va{S}$ and $A_{\text{hfs}}$ is the strength of the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction.
Note that there are no higher order contributions (e.g., electric quadrupole) since the valence electron is in an $s$ state (i.e., only the contact interaction is non-zero) \cite{Arimondo1977.RMP.49.31}.
Following the usual procedure by defining $\va{F} = \va{J} + \va{I}$, the energy shift can be evaluated as
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}	=	\frac{A_{\text{hfs}}}{2} \ev*{\hat{\va{F}}^2 - \hat{\va{J}}^2 - \hat{\va{I}}^2}
								=	\frac{A_{\text{hfs}}}{2} \bqty{F \pqty{F + 1} - J \pqty{J + 1} - I \pqty{I + 1}}
\end{equation}
In the ground state of \Srion{87}{+}, $S=s={1}/{2}$ and $I={9}/{2}$ meaning the the $\nSLJ{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}$ is split in to $F = 4$ and $F = 5$ components.
Using $A_{\text{hfs}} = \SI{-1000473.673(11)}{\kHz}$\footnote{\citeauthor{Sunaoshi1993.HI.78.241} derived $A_{\text{hfs}}$ by measuring the splitting of the $\nSLJf{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}{4}$ and $\nSLJf{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}{5}$ ground state of \Srion{87}{+} in an ion trap. They measured the splitting to be $E_{F=4} - E_{F=5} = \SI{5002368.363(57)}{\kHz}$.} \cite{Sunaoshi1993.HI.78.241}, the $F=4$ and $F=5$ states are shifted by
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}	=	\begin{cases}
										-\frac{11}{4} A_{\text{hfs}} = \SI{2.751302601+-0.000000030}{\GHz}	,{}&{}	F=4	\\
										\frac{9}{4} A_{\text{hfs}} = \SI{-2.251065764+-0.000000025}{\GHz}	,{}&{}	F=5
									\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Notice that $\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}_{F=4}$ nearly matches the $\SI{2.74}{\GHz}$ discrepancy between the reported ionization limit of \Sr{87} and the ionization limit determined by mass-scaling from the bosonic isotopes. 
This seems reasonable since most of the earlier spectroscopic work on \Sr{87} primarily focused on the singlet Rydberg states of which converges to the upper $F = 4$ \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496} state of \Srion{87}{+}. 

****** THINK ABOUT THE TWO IONIZATION LIMITS IN PRA PAPER ******

In the analysis below, we used $E_{\text{ion}}^{87} = \SI{45932.1943+-0.0010}{\per\cm}$ for the ionization limit which was calculated by subtracting $\Delta E_{F=4}$ from the reported ionization limit of \Sr{87}.

\section{Hyperfine Rydberg States of \Sr{87}}

Accurate \textit{ab initio} theoretical descriptions of the Rydberg structure of multielectron atoms is currently challenging due to the interaction of the Rydberg electron with the ionic core. 
This interplay may lead to different configurations (``channels'') of the Rydberg electron and the ionic core which share the same total energy, angular momentum, and parity \cite{Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}.
When the ionic states are not well-separated from the Rydberg states, multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) is the commonly used method for analyzing the Rydberg states of these multielectron atoms which can describe the Rydberg state in terms of a few parameters \cite{Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Aymar1996.RMP.68.1015, Robicheaux2018.PRA.97.022508}\footnote{I think \cite{Cooke1985.PRA.32.2725}, referenced and followed by \cite{Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms}, would probably be a good paper to work through as they provide an example calculation.}. 

Focusing on two-electron systems (e.g., {\tsup{3}\text{He}}, {\tsup{9}\text{Be}}, {\tsup{25}\text{Mg}}, {\tsup{43}\text{Ca}}, \Sr{87}, {\tsup{135}\text{Ba}}, {\tsup{137}\text{Ba}}), we follow the approach adopted in \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496, Beigang1983.PRL.51.771, Beigang1988.JOSAB.5.2423} and separate the total Hamiltonian for the system in to a part which does not depend on the nuclear spin ($\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}$) and the hyperfine interaction ($\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}$) which does depend on the nuclear spin
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}^{I \neq 0} = \hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0} + \hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}
\end{equation}
$\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}}$ contains the effects up to the fine structure level. 
The convenience of separating out the $\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}$ term becomes apparent because the eigenenergies (up to the fine structure level) can be obtained from the Rydberg-Ritz formula
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rydberg-ritz}
	\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}}	=	E_{\text{ion}} - \frac{R}{\pqty{n - \mu_{n,L,S,J}}^{2}}
\end{equation}
with the quantum defect given by \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440, Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004}\footnote{** There's an interesting discussion on how the equation for quantum defect is supposed to be recursive with $n^{*} = n - \delta\pqty{n^{*}} = n - \delta_{0} - \delta_{2}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{2} - \delta_{4}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{4} - \cdots$ \cite{Drake1991.PRA.44.5448} vs. the power-series expansion presented in \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440} **.}
\begin{equation}
	\mu_{n,L,S,J}	=	\mu_{0} + \frac{\mu_{2}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{2}} + \frac{\mu_{4}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{4}} + \cdots
\end{equation}
Therefore, we only need to evaluate $\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}$ to obtain the hyperfine shifts.

The hyperfine interaction can be expressed as \cite{Woodgate.Elementary, Sobelman.Atomic, Bransden.Atoms}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_\text{hfs}	=	A \hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{J}}
						=	\sum_{i} A_{i} \hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{j}}_{i}
						=	\sum_{i} A_{i} \hat{\va{I}} \cdot \pqty{\hat{\va{l}}_{i} + \hat{\va{s}}_{i}}
\end{equation}
for electron $i \in \Bqty{1,2}$ with the (magnetic dipole) hyperfine constant $A$.
Therefore the contribution of each electron to the total hyperfine shift is
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{i}	=	A_{i} \ev*{\hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{j}}_{i}}
									=	\frac{A_{i}}{2} \bqty{f_{i} \pqty{f_{i} + 1} - I \pqty{I + 1} - j_{i} \pqty{j_{i} + 1}}
\end{equation}
We now consider a singly-excited Rydberg states where the ``inner'' electron in the $\ket{m s}$ state (i.e., an $s$ electron in the ground state of the ion) and the ``outer'' Rydberg electron in a $\ket{n \ell}$ state.
*** I don't really like this sudden transition.... ***
Recalling that the $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{i} \sim {1}/{n^{3}}$ ** \cite{Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725, Sobelman.Atomic, Bransden.Atoms} **, it follows that for high-$n$ Rydberg states, the $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{i}$ can be approximated as
\begin{align}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{\text{inner}}	&{}={}	A_{\text{inner}} \ev*{\hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{s}}_{\text{inner}}}	\\
	\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{\text{outer}}	&{}={}	A_{\text{outer}} \ev*{\hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{s}}_{\text{outer}}}	\approx	0
\end{align}
Since the ``outer'' electron does not significantly contribute to $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}$, it follows that $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}} \simeq \ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{\text{inner}}$.
Here, $A_{\text{inner}}$ is taken to be ** ? ** as the same value as $A$ in the $\nSLJ{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}$ state of \Srion{87}{+}.

Combining the above results, we can write the expected energies of the hyperfine Rydberg levels of isotopes with $I \neq 0$ as a shift from the ``unperturbed'' levels in an isotope with $I = 0$.

*** I need to come up with a better derivation.... I went down a bit of a rabbit hole above... ***

\subsection{Singly Excited $S$ states}

The calculation for the hyperfine shifts of singly excited $S$ Rydberg states is not too difficult with most of the details worked out in \cref{sec:hyperfine_mixing_derivation}. 
It can be shown that the four hyperfine basis states are $\ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}$, $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}$, $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}$, and $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}$.
Using these basis states, we can evaluate the matrix elements of the hyperfine interaction and find that only the $F = I$ states interact with the matrix elements \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496}
\begin{align}
	\bra{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	&{}={}	0										\\
	\bra{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	&{}={}	\frac{a_{ms}}{2} \sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	\\
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	&{}={}	\frac{a_{ms}}{2} \sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	\\
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	&{}={}	-\frac{a_{ms}}{2} 
\end{align}
Therefore, $\hat{H}^{I \neq 0}$ for the interacting $F = I$ states is
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}^{I \neq 0}	=	\hat{H}^{I = 0} + \hat{V}_\text{hfs}
						=	\begin{pmatrix}
								E_{\SLJ{1}{S}{0}}	&	0					\\ 
								0					&	E_{\SLJ{3}{S}{1}}
							\end{pmatrix}
						+	\frac{a_{ms}}{2}
							\begin{pmatrix}
								0					&	\sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	\\ 
								\sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	&	-1
							\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
As mentioned previously, $E_{\SLJ{1}{S}{0}}$ and $E_{\SLJ{3}{S}{1}}$ can be obtained from \cref{eq:rydberg-ritz} with the appropriate quantum defects for each series.

For singly excited Rydberg states $\ket{\nSLJM{5snl}{2S+1}{L}{J}{m_J}}_{J}$ with the ``inner'' electron in the $\ket{5s}$ state and the Rydberg electron in the $\ket{nl}$ state, the symmetric ($+$) and antisymmetric ($-$) orbital wave functions can be written as $\ket{L,m_L}_{L\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{ms;nl,m_L}\pm\ket{nl;ms,m_L}\right)$.
Combining the orbital and spin wave functions for singlet and triplet states are
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJM{msnl}{1}{L}{J}{m_J}}_{J}	&{}={}	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{ms;nl,m_L}+\ket{nl;ms,m_L}\right) \ket{0,0}_{S}	\notag	\\
											&{}={}	\ket{L,m_L=m_J}_{L+} \ket{0,0}_{S}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJM{msnl}{3}{L}{J}{m_J}}_{J}	&{}={}	\sum_{m_L} \sum_{m_S} \CG{L,m_L}{1,m_S}{J,m_J} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{ms;nl,m_L}-\ket{nl;ms,m_L}\right) \ket{1,m_S}_{S}	\notag	\\
											&{}={}	\sum_{m_S} \CG{L,m_L}{1,m_S}{J,m_J} \ket{L,m_L=m_J-m_S}_{L-} \ket{1,m_S}_{S}
\end{align}
with the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients defined as $\CG{J_1,M_1}{J_2,M_2}{J,M}=\braket{J_1,M_1;J_2,M_2}{J,M}$.



***************

For singly-excited $S$ Rydberg states in strontium with the `inner'' electron in the $\ket{5 s}$ state and the ``outer'' electron in the $\ket{n \ell}$ state, the singlet and triplet basis states can be written as
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{0}}	&{}={}	\frac{1}{2} \pqty{\ket{5s}\ket{ns} + \ket{}} \pqty{\ket{} - \ket{}}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{1}}	&{}={}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{0}}	&{}={}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{-1}}	&{}={}
\end{align}


***************

For singly-excited states, the hyperfine interaction of the ``outer'' electron with the core should scale as **$\sim 1/n^3$ \cite{Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725}? ** and should be negligible for high-lying states. 
We make the assumption that $\hat{V}_\text{hf} \simeq a_{ms} \hat{\bm{s}}_{\text{in}} \cdot \hat{\bm{I}}$ for singly-excited Rydberg states with inner electron $\ket{ms}$ and Rydberg electron $\ket{nl}$.
Expanding $\hat{\bm{s}}_\text{in}$ and $\hat{\bm{I}}$ in terms of ladder operators gives
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:V_hf}
	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \simeq \frac{a_{ms}}{2} \left(\hat{s}_{\text{in},+} \hat{I}_{-} + \hat{s}_{\text{in},-} \hat{I}_{+} + 2\hat{s}_{\text{in},z} \hat{I}_{z}\right)
\end{equation}
with the usual ladder operators $\hat{J}_{\pm}=\hat{J}_{x} \pm \hat{J}_{y}$. 
Note that $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ leaves the total spin $m_F$ unchanged, meaning it couples states of the same $m_F$. 

For a singly-excited Rydberg state where the Rydberg electron is in the $\ket{n \ell}$ state while the inner electron remains in the $\ket{m s}$ state, the Hamiltonian can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \pqty{\hat{H}_{0} + \hat{H}_{\text{fs}} + \zeta_{nl} \hat{\va{s}} \vdot \hat{\va{l}}} + a_{ms} \hat{\va{s}} \vdot \hat{\va{I}}
\end{equation}
where $\zeta_{nl}$ is the magnitude of the spin-orbit interaction (of the Rydberg electron), and $a_{ms}$ is the strength of the hyperfine interaction of the inner $s$ electron. 
Making the assumption that the terms $\pqty{\cdots}$ are the same for all isotopes, then the remaining hyperfine shift is simply due to the contact interaction between the remaining $ms$ electron and the ion.
This allows us to leverage the simpler spectroscopic data of the bosonic isotopes from which we can deduce the eigenstates and eigenenergies of an assumed $I = 0$ atom before incorporating isotope-specific hyperfine interactions.
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}^{I \neq 0}	=	\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0} \pqty{m_{I = 0}, m_{I \neq 0}} + \hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian that yields the eigenstates and eigenenergies, for \Sr{88} but scaled by the reduced mass $m_{87} = \flatfrac{m_{e} M_{87}}{\pqty{m_{e} + M_{87}}}$. $\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}$ is the hyperfine interaction, $m_{e}$ the electron mass and $M_{87}$ the mass of the \Srion{87}{+} ion.

Focusing on strontium, corrections beyond the elementary isotope shift, in particular, the mass polarization correction, was estimated from earlier data for helium Rydberg states \cite{Cok1979.PRA.19.1830, Cok1981.PRA.24.3283, vanderVeldt1990.PRA.41.4099} and are expected to be $\lesssim \SI{1}{\MHz}$ and are neglected.
Under this assumption, the energies of the \Sr{87} Rydberg states should be given by
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{H}^{87}}	=	\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}} + \ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}
\end{equation}
The values of $\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}}$ are easily determined from the Rydberg-Ritz formula
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rydberg-ritz}
	\ev*{\hat{H}^{87}}	=	\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}}
						=	E^{87}_{\text{ion}} - \frac{R^{87}_{\text{Sr}}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{n,L,S,J}}^{2}}
\end{equation}
with the quantum defect given by ** \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440, Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004} cite just Gallagher and Vaillant paper? **
\begin{equation}
	\mu_{n,L,S,J}	=	\mu_{0} + \frac{\mu_{2}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{2}} + \frac{\mu_{4}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{4}}
\end{equation}
** Use footnote? There's an interesting discussion on how the equation for quantum defect is supposed to be recursive with $n^{*} = n - \delta\pqty{n^{*}} = n - \delta_{0} - \delta_{2}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{2} - \delta_{4}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{4} - \cdots$ \cite{Drake1991.PRA.44.5448} vs. the power-series expansion presented in \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440}. **

An important consideration in determining when effects cannot be neglected is when the energy scales become comparable.
For tstrontium, the energy scale of the hyperfine interaction is given by $a_{5s}$ and, as $n$ increases this energy scale becomes comparable.
As seen in \cref{fig:n-scaling}, it first becomes comparable to the fine structure splitting, then the singlet-triplet splitting, then the Coulomb splitting.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

		The energy scale of the hyperfine interaction in \Sr{87} is approximately constant and is $\abs{a_{5s}} \approx \SI{1}{\GHz}$ \cite{Sunaoshi1993.HI.78.241}.

\end{figure}
From \cref{fig:n-scaling}, one would also expect hyperfine mixing to occur between $n \sim 10$ and $n \sim 20$ which was indeed observed \cite{Beigang1981.PRL.47.326, Beigang1982.PRL.48.290, Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}.
Hyperfine mixing was also observed between the $\nSLJ{5s19d}{1}{D}{2}$ and $\nSLJ{5s19d}{3}{D}{3}$ states \cite{Beigang1982.JPB.15.L201}.

%\subsection{Singly Excited $S$ states}

In the below, we follow the derivation outlined in \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496,Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}.
A more detailed derivation is provided in \cref{sec:hyperfine_mixing_derivation} where it is shown that $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ only mixes states of the same $F$.
** I need to actually do the derivation.... **

Assuming there are no perturbing states, a reasonable assumption for $n \gtrsim 12$ for the both the $\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{S}{0}$ and $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$ Rydberg series \cite{Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}, we start with the pure singly-excited singlet $\ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}$ and triplet $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}$, $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}$, and $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}$ hyperfine states.
Applying $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ to these basis states gives
\begin{align}
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} I \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	\\
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \sqrt{I\qty(I+1)} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	\\
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(\sqrt{I\qty(I+1)} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} - \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}})	\\
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(I+1) \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}
\end{align}
From the above, it's apparent that the unmixed states have energy shifts
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} I			\approx	\SI{-2.25}{\GHz}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(I+1)	\approx	\SI{2.75}{\GHz}
\end{equation}
The matrix elements of the mixed $F=I$ states are
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \sqrt{I\qty(I+1)}
\end{equation}
Therefore $F=I$ submatrix of the block-diagonal $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ matrix can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_\text{hf}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s}
							\begin{pmatrix}
								0							& \sqrt{I\left(I+1\right)}	\\ 
								\sqrt{I\left(I+1\right)}	& -1						\\ 
							\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Diagonalizing the total Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}_\text{hf}$ gives the eigenenergies
\begin{equation}
	E^{\pm}	=	\frac{E_{1}+E_{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{4} a_{5s} \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\qty(E_{1}-E_{3})^2 + a_{5s} \qty(E_{1}-E_{3}) + a_{5s}^{2} \qty(I + \frac{1}{2})^2}
\end{equation}
Taking the limit $a_{5s} \rightarrow 0$ (i.e., no hyperfine interaction), we observe $E^{+} \rightarrow E\qty(\SLJ{1}{S}{0})$ and $E^{-} \rightarrow E\qty(\SLJ{3}{S}{1})$ meaning $E^{+}$ corresponds to the energy of $\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}}$ and $E^{+}$ corresponds to energy of $\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{9/2}}$.

\subsubsection{$n$-mixing}

At higher $n$, the hyperfine shift becomes comparable to the splitting between $n$ and $n^{\prime} = n \pm 1$ as seen in \cref{fig:n-scaling}. 
Hyperfine-induced $n$-mixing was experimentally observed around $n = \num{113}$ between the $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}$ and $\nSLJf{5s\qty(n+1)s}{3}{S}{1}{9/2}$ states \cite{Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}.

The derivation above can be extended to incorporate $n$-mixing. 
Using the fact that $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ only couples states with the same $F$ and the orthogonality of the radial wave functions for states of same spin multiplet but different $n$, the diagonal matrix elements of $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ for $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I+1}$ and $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I-1}$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5sn^{\prime}s}{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} I \delta_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5sn^{\prime}s}{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(I+1) \delta_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
The off-diagonal elements vanish between these states because they remain uncoupled.


****** I don't think I can do this ``expansion''... I think I want to just calculate matrix elements between n and n' states ******
On the other hand, because $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ mixes the $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}$ and $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}$ states, we can write
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}}	{}={}&	\ket{\nSLJf{n}{1}{S}{0}{I}} + \sum_{n^{\prime}}{\ket{\nSLJf{n^{\prime}}{3}{S}{1}{I}}}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}}	{}={}&	\ket{\nSLJf{n}{3}{S}{1}{I}} + \sum_{n^{\prime}}{\ket{\nSLJf{n^{\prime}}{1}{S}{0}{I}}}
\end{align}
where $\nSLJf{n}{1}{S}{0}{I}$ and $\nSLJf{n}{3}{S}{1}{I}$ represent pure singly-excited singlet and triplet $F=I$ states (recalling that the radial wave functions are orthogonal for $n \neq n^{\prime}$ for states in the same spin multiplet).
Calculating the matrix elements of $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ between $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}$ and $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}$ gives
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5s{n^\prime}s}{1}{S}{0}{I}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5s{n^\prime}s}{3}{S}{1}{I}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \delta_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
The off-diagonal elements can be expressed as
\begin{align}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5s{n^\prime}s}{1}{S}{0}{I}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}}
		{}={}&	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} (stuff to finish deriving)	\notag	\\
		{}={}&	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \sqrt{I \qty(I+1)} O_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{align}
where $O_{n,n^{\prime}}$ is the overlap between the singlet and triplet radial wave functions which can be estimated semiclassically \cite{Bhatti1981.PRA.24.161, Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}
\begin{equation}
	O_{n_{1},n_{2}}
		=	\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{n_{2}^{*}}
		=	\qty(-1)^{n_{2}-n_{1}} \frac{2 \sqrt{n_{1}^{*} n_{2}^{*}}}{n_{1}^{*} + n_{2}^{*}} \frac{\sin[\pi \qty(n_{2}^{*} - n_{1}^{*})]}{\pi \qty(n_{2}^{*} - n_{1}^{*})}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering

\end{figure}

Between adjacent $n$ (i.e., for $n_{2} = n_{1} + 1$) and $\delta_{2} \neq \delta_{1}$, the approximation reduces to
\begin{equation}
	O_{n_{1},n_{1}+1}
		=	\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}}
		=	-\frac{2 \sqrt{n_{1}^{*} \qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}}}{n_{1}^{*} + \qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}} \frac{\sin[\pi \qty(\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*} - n_{1}^{*})]}{\pi \qty(\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*} - n_{1}^{*})}
\end{equation}
Since the $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}$ state is always higher in energy than the $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{9/2}$, they should cross when $n_{1}$ corresponds to the singlet state and $n_{2} = n_{1} + 1$ corresponds to the triplet state. 
Using the quantum defects from \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004}, we expect $\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}} \approx \num{0.1}$ and $\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}} \approx \num{0.05}$ so we only include $n$ and $n+1$ mixing.

As see in \cref{fig:semiclassical_overlap}, the strongest $n$-mixing occurs for $\Delta n = \pm 1$ with $O_{n,n^{\prime}} \approx \num{0.1}$ and quickly drops off for larger $\Delta n$.

\subsection{Singly Excited $D$ states}

Even before including hyperfine interactions, the spin-orbit interactions leads to a breakdown of $LS$ coupling and mixes the $\SLJ{1}{D}{2}$ and $\SLJ{3}{D}{2}$ states and is especially strong around $n = \num{15}$ where they swap singlet and triplet character \cite{Esherick1977.PRA.15.1920, Beigang1981.PRL.47.326, Beigang1982.PRL.48.290, Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725, Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}.
To account for this mixing, the eigenstates $\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{D}{2}$ and $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{D}{2}$ of the $H_{0}\qty(88, m_{87})$ are expanded as
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{D}{2}}	&{}={}	\cos\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{1}{D}{2}} + \sin\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{3}{D}{2}} \\
	\ket{\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{D}{2}}	&{}={}	-\sin\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{1}{D}{2}} + \cos\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{3}{D}{2}}
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is the mixing angle \cite{Sun1989.JPB.22.2887} of the pure singlet $\ket{\nSLJ{n}{1}{D}{2}}$ and triplet $\ket{\nSLJ{n}{3}{D}{2}}$ states.
*** For higher $n$, the singlet-triplet mixing of the $\SLJ{1}{D}{2}$ and $\SLJ{3}{D}{2}$ states becomes nearly $n$ independent as evidenced by their quantum defects \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004, Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503}. **
Calculations using a two-active-electron (TAE) model \cite{Ye2013.PRA.88.043430, Fields2018.PRA.97.013429} estimates that converges towards $\theta \sim \num{-0.16}$ for high $n$.
** Where does $\theta \sim \num{-0.14}$ come from? **

** See \cite{Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725} for a calculation of mixing coefficients? **

Calculating the hyperfine matrix elements of the $D$ states is quite a bit more challenging than for the $S$ states. 
In total, there are $\num{20}$ singly excited $D$ states ($\nSLJ{5snd}{1}{D}{2}$, $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{1}$, $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{2}$, and $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{3}$) which each have $2 I + 1 = 10$ nuclear spin states. 
The matrix elements of $\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}$ can be evaluated analytically \cite{Lurio1962.PR.126.1758, Sun1989.JPB.22.2887, Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725}.

Due to these interactions, it's not clear how to assign the different states since $S$ and $J$ are no longer good quantum numbers. 
Instead, the state assignments were made by evaluating the overlap of the hyperfine-mixed states with the unperturbed $\nSLJ{5sns}{2S+1}{D}{J}$ state.

The cooling and trapping of strontium was described previously in this thesis so it will only be briefly covered here. 
Following the standard procedure for laser cooling strontium, we start from a Zeeman slowed atomic beam with the Zeeman laser tuned to $\SLJ{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \SLJ{1}{P}{1}$ resonance in \Sr{87}.
The slowed atoms are then captured by a blue MOT operating on the same transition which cools the atoms down to $\sim \SI{2}{\milli\kelvin}$. 
Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT driving the $\SLJ{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \SLJ{3}{P}{1}$ transition.
Approximately $\SI{1E6}{atoms}$ at $\SI{\sim 2}{\mu\kelvin}$ are captured before turning off all trapping fields for spectroscopy measurements.

Rydberg atoms are created by two-photon excitation using counterpropagating cross-linearly polarized $\SI{689}{\nm}$ and $\SI{319}{\nm}$ excitation lasers which drive transitions to the $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$ and $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{1,2,3}$ Rydberg levels via the intermediate $\nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{9/2}$ or $F = 11/2$ states (see \cref{fig:spectroscopy_exp_setup}(b)).
These intermediate states were selected to take advantage of selection rules to aid in identifying the Rydberg hyperfine states populated.
The typical detunings of the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ laser, with respect to the intermediate states, were $\Delta_{9/2} \sim \SI{36}{MHz}$ and $\Delta_{11/2} \sim \SI{12}{\MHz}$, respectively. 
During excitation, the $\SI{319}{\nm}$ laser was kept on while the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ laser was chopped into $\SIrange[range-phrase=-]{10}{20}{\us}$-long pulses to generate temporally localized groups of Rydberg atoms. 
The number of Rydberg atoms produced by each pulse was determined by using the electrodes in \cref{fig:spectroscopy_exp_setup} to generate a ramped electric field sufficient to ionize the Rydberg atoms with the resulting electrons directed towards, and detected by, a micro-channel plate (MCP) whose output was fed into a multichannel scalar (MCS).
Typically $\numrange[range-phrase=-]{100}{500}$ measurement cycles were performed before loading a new sample and changing the $\SI{319}{\nm}$ laser frequency. 
Spectroscopic measurements at high~$n$ using \Sr{84} showed that the stray fields in the trapping region were less than $\SI{10}{\mV\per\cm}$ so any resultant Stark shifts should therefore be at most a few megahertz even at $n \sim 90$.

The $\SI{319}{\nm}$ radiation was generated by frequency doubling the output of a $\SI{638}{\nm}$ optical parametric oscillator (OPO). 
A sample of the output is sent though a broadband fiber electro-optic modulator (fEOM) from which one of the tunable sidebands was locked to a transfer cavity, allowing the $\SI{319}{\nm}$ laser to be scanned over multiple gigahertz.
The transfer cavity was stabilized using a $\SI{689}{\nm}$ master laser locked to the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ transition in \Sr{88}. 
The linewidth of the $\SI{319}{\nm}$ laser is estimated to be $\lesssim \SI{500}{\kHz}$ based on the narrowest observed spectroscopic features.
The wavelength of the $\SI{638}{\nm}$ laser was measured with an EXFO WA-1500 wavemeter. 
% Other version using lesssim in \SI: $\SI[input-comparators=\lesssim]{\lesssim500}{\kHz}$

\subsection{Calibrating the EXFO WA-1500 Wavemeter}

Since we rely on the wavemeter to determine the absolute energy of the $\SI{638}{\nm}$ photon, we want to characterize potential systematic offsets. 
We first attempted to perform Doppler-free spectroscopy of molecular iodine ({\tsup{127}I\tsub{2}}) using the ${P65~\left(7–4\right)}$ line at \SI{15672.517398(25)}{\per\cm} \cite{Sansonetti1997.JOSAB.14.1913} which is near the $\SI{638}{\nm}$ required to excite the $\nSLJ{5s40s}{3}{S}{1}$ Rydberg state.
We didn't have much luck finding narrow Doppler-free signals scanning the $\SI{638}{\nm}$ laser through a our iodine cell using a simple saturated absorption setup\footnote{This matches similar experiences according to Jason Nguyen and Henry Luo in the Hulet lab when they were looking to use an iodine cell to lock their $\SI{646}{\nm}$ laser for a \Li{6} UV MOT \cite{Duarte2011.PRA.84.061406}.}.
A longer cell and a more sensitive detection method may be necessary since most {\tsup{127}I\tsub{2}} spectroscopy setups in this wavelength range used cells longer than $\SI{30}{\cm}$ and some sort of modulation spectroscopy (e.g., \cite{Sansonetti1997.JOSAB.14.1913, Huang2018.AO.57.2102, Onishchenko2019.PRA.99.052503}).

Although the iodine spectroscopy didn't work out, we were able to calibrate the wavemeter by measuring wavelengths of lasers lock to atomic transitions in \Sr{88} ($\SI{689}{\nm}$) and \Li{6} ($\SI{671}{\nm}$ and $\SI{646}{\nm}$).
The $\SI{689}{\nm}$ reference comes from our red master laser locked to the $\SLJ{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \SLJ{3}{P}{1}$ in \Sr{88}.
Ya-Ting Chang, Danyel Cavazos, and Dr. Randy Hulet were kind enough to let us run a fiber between the Killian and Hulet labs in order to measure the wavelengths of their $\SI{671}{\nm}$ and $\SI{646}{\nm}$ lasers for laser cooling \Li{6}. 
They used the $\SI{671}{\nm}$ for a standard $D_{2}$ MOT while the $\SI{646}{\nm}$ is frequency doubled to $\SI{323}{\nm}$ for narrow line cooling with a UV MOT \cite{Duarte2011.PRA.84.061406}.
The wavemeter measurements of those three wavelengths were performed within about $\SI{2}{\hour}$ to reduce sensitivity to environmental changes and are presented in \cref{tab:wavemeter_calibration}.
\begin{table}[htbp]

All $\SI{638}{\nm}$ measurements were accompanied by a $\SI{689}{\nm}$ reference measurement under the assumption that the differences between the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ and $\SI{638}{\nm}$ wavelengths are less sensitive to the environment than the absolute values reported by the wavemeter.
The values in \cref{tab:wavemeter_calibration} were used to calculate the offset $\delta = \nu_{\text{measured}} - \nu_{\text{reference}}$ between our measured and reported values and is plotted in \cref{fig:wm_fit}.

		The black line shows the linear fit used to obtain the offset at $\SI{638}{\nm}$ and the shaded region the uncertainty in the wavemeter calibration obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.}
\end{figure}
A linear fit yields a correction of $\approx \SI{140}{\MHz}$ at $\SI{638}{\nm}$. 
A Monte Carlo sampling was adopted in which linear fits to points drawn at random from the Gaussian uncertainty distributions appropriate to each point in the calibration were repeated, resulting in a systematic uncertainty ($\sigma_\mathrm{sys}$) of about $\pm \SI{25}{\MHz}$ ($\pm \SI{50}{\MHz}$) at $\SI{638}{\nm}$ ($\SI{319}{\nm}$). 

We also used the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ reference measurements to check for drifts in the wavemeter over time. 
As shown in the inset in \cref{fig:wm_drift}, the day-to-day variations were relatively small compared to the wavemeter's systematic uncertainty.

\end{figure}
Whereas our wavemeter limits the measurements of individual term energies to $\approx \SI{60}{\MHz}$, line separations can be measured to kilohertz-level accuracies when scanning within a single free spectral range (FSR) of the transfer cavity, and to megahertz-level accuracies when piecing together scans over successive FSRs.

% \subsection{Two-photon Rydberg excitation spectrum}

% While taking the Rydberg spectra, we observed spurious electron counts when the UV laser detuning compensated for the \SI{689}{\nm} detuning. 
% Due to this coincidence, we believe these ``ghost'' lines are due to atoms in the $\nSLJF{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{9/2,11/2}$ state which were off-resonantly excited by a \SI{689}{\nm} photon before a \SI{319}{\nm} photon excites them to a Rydberg state. 
% To check for this effect, we use the density matrix method **Lindblad operator** to simulate the time-dependent dynamics with parameter values estimated from the measured excitation laser powers and beam waists. 

% **Show example spectra with ``ghost'' on-resonance counts.**

\section{Results and Discussion}

\Cref{tab:data-s-state} lists the measured term energies for multiple $\nSLJ{5sns}{1,3}{S}{}$ \Sr{87} Rydberg states for $30 \lesssim n \lesssim 99$.
\Cref{fig:results-qd-1S0} and \cref{fig:results-qd-3S1} shows the quantum defects calculated with the Rydberg-Ritz formula ** cite equation above? need to have equation above... ** from the reported term energies for \Sr{88} combined with those extracted from the current measurements in \Sr{87}.
For \Sr{88}, the most recent value of the ionization limit was used along with the mass-scaled Rydberg constant\footnote{$E^{88}_{\text{ion}} = \SI{45932.20024+-0.00033}{\per\cm}$ \cite{Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503} and $R^{88}_{\text{Sr}} = \SI{109736.6308675+-0.0000007}{\per\cm}$. See \cref{sec:rydberg_properties}.}.
For \Sr{87}, the hyperfine shifts for each state was calculated by Shuhei Yoshida and were subtracted from the measured term energy to obtain the quantum defect for an effective $I = 0$ \Sr{87} atom.

The $n = 50$ and $60$ states were excited via the intermediate $\nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{9/2}$ state (scheme {(\romannumeral 2)}), allowing the creation of states with $F = 7/2, 9/2,\, \text{and} \, 11/2$.

These figures also includes the best theoretical fit to the data that could be obtained.
This was realized by first determining the values of the quantum defects $\mu_{n,S,L,J}$ that best reproduce the measured energy levels and then using these to update the Rydberg-Ritz expression (** 16 **) for the $n$ dependence of the quantum defect at high $n$ (see ** Table III **).
The predicted levels shown in ** Fig. 7 ** are derived using the updated Rydberg-Ritz formulas.
However, since the measured quantum defects of \Sr{88} $\SLJ{1}{D}{2}$ states (with $I = 0$) are available up to $n = 70$, the Rydberg-Ritz expression from ** [18] ** is used for these states.
The measured quantum defects for the $\SLJ{3}{D}{}$ states are shown in ** Fig. 8 ** together with the values given by both the present and the earlier Rydberg-Ritz expressions.
The differences between the predicted quantum defects ** [Eq. (16)] ** based on the present data for \Sr{87} and previous data for \Sr{88} ** [18] ** appear to be small, $\sim \num{0.02}$. 
However, when converted to energy, this small difference translates into discrepancies of $\SI{130}{\MHz}$ for $n = 100$ and $\SI{1}{GHz}$ for $n = 50$ well outside the uncertainty of the current experiment.

The present Rydberg-Ritz formulas can also be tested against earlier measured quantum defects for $D$ states in \Sr{87} ($n > 100$) ** [26] **. 
The data are reproduced to within an average difference of $\sim \SI{60}{\MHz}$.
When the modified ionization limit discussed above is used to evaluate the quantum defect, the average difference is reduced to $\sim \SI{25}{\MHz}$.
These residual differences could be caused by stray fields present in the heat pipe used for the earlier work. 
Additionally, the current theoretical model can predict the hyperfine structure of $D$ states around $n \simeq 280$, which can again be compared with
the earlier measurements ** [40] **.
Due to the uncertainty in the ionization threshold, the exact energies cannot be evaluated but the size of the hyperfine splittings is well reproduced
within an error of $\SI{10}{\MHz}$.

Finally, the improved Rydberg-Ritz formulas for the $\SLJ{3}{D}{}$ states determined from the present data for \Sr{87} can be used to determine spectroscopic information for \Sr{88}Sr.
When we compare energies for the $5s50d$ and $5s80d$ $\SLJ{3}{D}{1,2}$ states derived using the present updated Rydberg-Ritz formulas with earlier measurements ** [50,51] ** the agreement is significantly improved over that obtained using the earlier Rydberg-Ritz parametrization, the differences between theory and experiment being reduced by several hundred megahertz.

As a further test of the present theoretical approach, ** Table II ** includes the frequency separations between selected pairs of levels that could be measured during a single FSR scan of the $\SI{319}{\nm}$ laser and that are known to high precision.
** Table II ** also includes the corresponding theoretical predictions. 
In all but one case the measured and theoretical separations agree to better than $\pm \SI{10}{\MHz}$.

\section{Conclusion}

** Update and reword the summary from PRA !! **

The present work demonstrates that the energies of {high-$n$} \Sr{87} Rydberg states can be accurately determined by diagonalizing an isotope-rescaled Hamiltonian.
This Hamiltonian is constructed using spectral information for the bosonic isotope (\Sr{88}) which has vanishing nuclear spin combined with the hyperfine interaction present in \Sr{87}.
The present approach can be implemented for fermionic atoms whenever the energy levels for an isotope with vanishing nuclear spin are available.
The method can also be applied in reverse, allowing determination of spectroscopic information, in particular quantum defects, for bosonic isotopes from the hyperfine-resolved spectrum of the fermionic isotope.
The major limitation on the accuracy of the present analysis is the uncertainty in the hyperfine-resolved ionization threshold.
This uncertainty can be removed by focusing on energy differences to a reference level whereupon accuracies of the order of a few megahertz can be achieved. 

***************************

Although the hyperfine interaction complicates the Rydberg spectra of \Sr{87}, it does offer some interesting possibilities. 
One possibility is to access Rydberg states with either attractive ($\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{S}{0}$) or repulsive ($\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$) $C_{6}$ coefficients \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004} from the $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ intermediate due to the hyperfine mixing.
