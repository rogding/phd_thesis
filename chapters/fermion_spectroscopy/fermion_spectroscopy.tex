\chapter{Spectroscopy of $\Sr{87}$ Triplet Rydberg States}
\label{ch:fermion_spectroscopy}

As mentioned in \cref{sec:sr_rydberg_atoms}, strontium offers the possibility for exciting ULRRMs in ultracold bosonic, fermionic, and (nearly ideal) classical gases.
In these samples, quantum statistics are expected to affect the excitation rate of ULRRMs where bosonic and fermionic samples are expected to exhibit enhanced and suppressed ULRRM excitation rates, respectively, whereas no change is expected in a classical gas. 
In order to produce ULRRMs, it is necessary to locate and identify the parent Rydberg states. 

An ultracold bosonic gas is represented by \Sr{84} due to the ease of evaporation but, in principle, any of the bosonic isotopes can be used\footnote{An ``ideal'' bosonic gas would better represented by \Sr{88} as $a_{s} \approx 0$ but this isotope difficult to evaporate.}.
Since most spectroscopic studies of strontium Rydberg systems having focused on the most abundant isotope, \Sr{88}, which has no nuclear spin ($I = 0$), there exists a plethora of data available. 
The lack of nuclear spin leads to relatively simple excitation spectra and is relatively well understood \cite{Esherick1977.PRA.15.1920, Beigang1982.OC.42.19, Beigang1982.PS.26.183, Kunze1993.ZPD.27.111, Dai1995.JQSRT.54.1019, Dai1995.PRA.52.4416, Philip2007.OC.279.141, Jackson2018.PhD, Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503}, making it easy to locate \Sr{84} Rydberg states upon appropriate rescaling of the Rydberg constant and using the appropriate ionization limit. 

The fermionic and (approximately) classical ultracold samples are represented by a spin-polarized and unpolarized gas of \Sr{87}, respectively. 
In contrast to \Sr{88}, relatively few studies have been done on \Sr{87}, which has strong hyperfine interactions due to its large $I = {9}/{2}$ nuclear spin. 
It is this hyperfine interaction that significantly complicates the Rydberg excitation spectrum.
Of the previous experimental work \cite{Beigang1981.ZPhys.301.93, Beigang1981.PRL.47.326, Beigang1982.PRL.48.290, Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496, Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}, excitation was performed to singlet $\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{S}{0}$ and $\nSLJ{5snd}{1}{D}{2}$ Rydberg states, with triplet states being observed due to state mixing. 

In order to better understand the \Sr{87} Rydberg series with the goal of producing ULRRMs, we mapped the triplet Rydberg series by directly exciting $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$ and $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{1,2,3}$ hyperfine states through the intermediate $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ state. 
To our knowledge, this is the first direct measurement of the \Sr{87} Rydberg states by direct excitation through the $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ state.

\section{Ionization Limit of $\Sr{87}$}

The first indication that the Rydberg levels of $\Sr{87}$ were not as simple as for the bosonic isotopes was the reported ionization limit, $E_{\text{ion}}^{87} = \SI{45932.2861(10)}{\per\cm}$ \cite{Beigang1982.OC.42.19, Sansonetti2010.JPCRD.39.033103}, being well above those of the bosonic isotopes (see \cref{fig:Eion-mass-scaled} and \cref{tab:ionization_limits}). 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio, width=4.5in, height=\textheight]{fermion_spectroscopy/calculations/Eion-mass-scaled.pdf}
	\caption{

		See \cref{ap:sr_data} for isotopic masses and ionization energies.}
\end{figure}
Mass-scaling the ionization energies of the bosonic isotopes suggests that the ionization energy for an assumed $I=0$ \Sr{87} atom should be approximately $\SI{45932.1946+-0.0005}{\per\cm}$, about $\SI{2.74}{\GHz}$ below the reported ionization energy.

The source of this discrepancy is likely related to the hyperfine interaction in the ground state of \Srion{87}{+} since is has a rubidium-like structure with a single valence $s$ electron outside a filled {[Kr]} core.
The hyperfine interaction can be written as (see, e.g., \cite{Steck.QuantumAtomOptics})
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}	=	A_{\text{hf}} \hat{\va{I}} \vdot \hat{\va{J}}
						=	A_{\text{hf}} \hat{\va{I}} \vdot \hat{\va{S}}
\end{equation}
where $\va{J} = \va{L} + \va{S}$ and $A_{\text{hf}}$ is the strength of the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction.
Note that there are no higher order contributions (e.g., electric quadrupole) since the valence electron is in an $s$ state so only the contact interaction is non-zero \cite{Arimondo1977.RMP.49.31}.
Following the usual procedure by defining $\va{F} = \va{J} + \va{I}$, the energy shift can be evaluated as
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}}	=	\frac{A_{\text{hf}}}{2} \ev*{\hat{\va{F}}^2 - \hat{\va{J}}^2 - \hat{\va{I}}^2}
								=	\frac{A_{\text{hf}}}{2} \bqty{F \pqty{F + 1} - J \pqty{J + 1} - I \pqty{I + 1}}
\end{equation}
In the ground state of \Srion{87}{+}, $S=s={1}/{2}$ and $I={9}/{2}$ meaning the the $\nSLJ{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}$ is split in to $F = 4$ and $F = 5$ components.
Using $A_{\text{hf}} = \SI{-1000473.673(11)}{\kHz}$\footnote{\citeauthor{Sunaoshi1993.HI.78.241} determined $A_{\text{hf}}$ by measuring the splitting of the $\nSLJf{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}{4}$ and $\nSLJf{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}{5}$ ground state of \Srion{87}{+} in an ion trap. They measured the splitting to be $E_{F=4} - E_{F=5} = \SI{5002368.363(57)}{\kHz}$.} \cite{Sunaoshi1993.HI.78.241}, the $F=4$ and $F=5$ states are shifted by
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}}	=	\begin{cases}
										-\frac{11}{4} A_{\text{hf}} = \SI{2.751302601+-0.000000030}{\GHz}	,{}&{}	F=4	\\
										\frac{9}{4} A_{\text{hf}} = \SI{-2.251065764+-0.000000025}{\GHz}	,{}&{}	F=5
									\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Notice that $\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}\pqty*{F=4}} \approx \SI{2.75}{\GHz}$ nearly matches the $\SI{2.74}{\GHz}$ discrepancy between the reported ionization limit of \Sr{87} and the ionization limit determined by mass-scaling from the bosonic isotopes. 
This seems reasonable since most of the earlier spectroscopic work on \Sr{87} primarily focused on the singlet Rydberg states of which converges to the upper $F = 4$ \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496} state of \Srion{87}{+}. 

% In the analysis below, we used $E_{\text{ion}}^{87} = \SI{45932.1956+-0.0007}{\per\cm}$ for the ionization limit instead of the slightly lower value $E_{\text{ion}}^{87} = \SI{45932.1943+-0.0010}{\per\cm}$ obtained by subtracting $\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}_{F=4}$ from the reported \Sr{87} ionization limit in \cite{Beigang1982.OC.42.19, Sansonetti2010.JPCRD.39.033103}.
% As described in \cite{Ding2018.PRA.98.042505}, it was found that the higher $E_{\text{ion}}^{87}$ resulted in the quantum defects of the $\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{S}{0}$ and $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$ states converging to a nearly constant value.

\section{Additional Material}

The following section includes additional material not included in the published paper. 

\subsection{$n$ Scaling of Various Splittings}

As mentioned above, the hyperfine interaction remains approximately independent of $n$ whereas various splittings decrease with increasing $n$. 
This is illustrated in \cref{fig:deltaE} where the experimentally determined fine-structure, singlet-triplet, and Coulomb splitting in \Sr{88} are plotted. 
\Cref{fig:n-scaling} shows the same information as  \cref{fig:deltaE} (plotted for $n$ instead of $n^{*}$) but with more splittings and was computed using the most recently reported ionization limit and quantum defects for \Sr{88} in \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004, Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includesvg[keepaspectratio, width=\textwidth, height=\textheight]{fermion_spectroscopy/calculations/n-scaling.svg}
	\caption{
		\label{fig:n-scaling}
		The $n$ scaling of various splittings in \Sr{88} calculated using the most recently reported quantum defects and ionization energy \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004, Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503}.
		The energy scale of the hyperfine interaction in \Sr{87} is approximately constant and is $\abs{a_{5s}} \approx \SI{1}{\GHz}$ \cite{Sunaoshi1993.HI.78.241}.
		The splittings between various states are represented by $\Delta E^{\pqty{0}}_{X}$ between the given states where $X=S$ is the singlet-triplet splitting, $X=J$ is the fine structure splitting, and $X=n$ is the Coulomb splitting.}
\end{figure}
The strength of hyperfine interaction can be related to the contact interaction of the inner $5s$ electron with the \Srion{87}{+} core $\abs*{a_{5s}} \simeq \SI{1}{\GHz}$ \cite{Sunaoshi1993.HI.78.241}. 

Working in the $LS$-coupled basis (even though it is no longer a good quantum number), it is possible to estimate where hyperfine state mixing will occur by finding when $\abs*{a_{5s}}$ becomes comparable to a particular energy splitting in \cref{fig:n-scaling}.
For example, \cref{fig:n-scaling} suggests that hyperfine mixing should occur between the $\nSLJ{5snd}{1}{D}{2}$ and the $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{2}$ states near $n = 14$ and between the $\nSLJ{5snd}{1}{D}{2}$ and the $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{3}$ states near $n = 20$.
Indeed, both were observed experimentally with large shifts reported in the spectra of \Sr{87} $\nSLJ{5snd}{1}{D}{2}$ hyperfine Rydberg states around $n = 16$ \cite{Beigang1981.PRL.47.326, Beigang1982.PRL.48.290} and $n = 19$ \cite{Beigang1982.JPB.15.L201}. 

\subsection{Singly Excited $\SLJ{}{S}{}$ State Hyperfine Mixing Matrix}

The matrix elements for hyperfine mixing of the $\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{S}{0}$ and the $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$ are not too difficult to work out.

For the singly excited $\SLJ{}{S}{}$ states, there are four hyperfine basis states can be expanded in terms of the $\ket*{J, m_J}_{J}$ basis and the nuclear spin $\ket*{I, m_I}_{I}$ state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\nSLJfM{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}{m_F}}	=	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{0}} \ket{I, m_I = m_F}_{I}
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJfM{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I+1}{m_F}}	&{}={}	\sum_{m_J} \sum_{m_I} \CG{J=1,m_J}{I,m_I}{F=I+1,m_F} \ket{\SLJM{3}{S}{1}{m_J}} \ket{I,m_I}_{I}	\notag \\
									&{}={}	\sum_{m_J} \CG{J=1,m_J}{I,m_I}{F=I+1,m_F} \ket{\SLJM{3}{S}{1}{m_J}} \ket{I,m_I=m_F-m_J}_{I}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJfM{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}{m_F}}	&{}={}	\sum_{m_J} \sum_{m_I} \CG{J=1,m_J}{I,m_I}{F=I,m_F} \ket{\SLJM{3}{S}{1}{m_J}} \ket{I,m_I}_{I}	\notag \\
									&{}={}	\sum_{m_J} \CG{J=1,m_J}{I,m_I}{F=I,m_F} \ket{\SLJM{3}{S}{1}{m_J}} \ket{I,m_I=m_F-m_J}_{I}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJfM{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I-1}{m_F}}	&{}={}	\sum_{m_J} \sum_{m_I} \CG{J=1,m_J}{I,m_I}{F=I-1,m_F} \ket{\SLJM{3}{S}{1}{m_J}} \ket{I,m_I}_{I}	\notag \\
									&{}={}	\sum_{m_J} \CG{J=1,m_J}{I,m_I}{F=I-1,m_F} \ket{\SLJM{3}{S}{1}{m_J}} \ket{I,m_I=m_F-m_J}_{I}
\end{align}

The hyperfine interaction operator can be expanded in terms of raising and lower operators for **** FIX ****
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \pqty{\hat{s}_{\text{in,+}} \hat{I}_{-} + \hat{s}_{\text{in,-}} \hat{I}_{+} + 2 \hat{s}_{\text{in,+}} \hat{I}_{-}}
\end{equation}
Applying each operator to the basis states gives
\begin{align}
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},+}\ket{n\SLJm{1}{S}{0}{0}}^0	=	-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{1}}^{0}												\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},-}\ket{n\SLJm{1}{S}{0}{0}}^0	=	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{-1}}^{0}												\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},z}\ket{n\SLJm{1}{S}{0}{0}}^0	=	\frac{1}{2} \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{0}}^{0}														\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},+}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{1}}^0	=	0																								\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},-}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{1}}^0	=	-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{n\SLJm{1}{S}{0}{0}}^{0} - \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{0}}^{0}\right)	\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},z}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{1}}^0	=	\frac{1}{2} \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{1}}^{0}														\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},+}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{0}}^0	=	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{1}}^{0}													\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},-}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{0}}^0	=	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{-1}}^{0}												\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},z}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{0}}^0	=	\frac{1}{2} \ket{n\SLJm{1}{S}{0}{0}}^{0}														\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},+}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{-1}}^0	=	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{n\SLJm{1}{S}{0}{0}}^{0} + \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{0}}^{0}\right)		\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},-}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{-1}}^0	=	0																								\\
	& \hat{s}_{\text{in},z}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{-1}}^0	=	-\frac{1}{2} \ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{-1}}^{0}
\end{align}
For the $\hat{I}$ operators, 
\begin{align}
	& \hat{I}_{+} \ket{I,m_I}	=	\sqrt{I\left(I+1\right) - m_I \left(m_I+1\right)} \ket{I,m_I+1}	\\
	& \hat{I}_{-} \ket{I,m_I}	=	\sqrt{I\left(I+1\right) - m_I \left(m_I-1\right)} \ket{I,m_I-1}	\\
	& \hat{I}_{z} \ket{I,m_I}	=	m_I \ket{I,m_I}
\end{align}
Now that we know all the relevant states, we can calculate the effect of $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ on each state. 
** For simplicity, we used the stretched states $\ket{I=F, m_I=F}$ (provide a better argument?) **
\begin{align}
	& \hat{V}_\text{hf}\ket{n\SLJm{1}{S}{0}{0}}^{0}		=	\frac{a_{5s}}{2}	\\
	& \hat{V}_\text{hf}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{1}}^{0}		=	\frac{a_{5s}}{2}	\\
	& \hat{V}_\text{hf}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{0}}^{0}		=	\frac{a_{5s}}{2}	\\
	& \hat{V}_\text{hf}\ket{n\SLJm{3}{S}{1}{-1}}^{0}	=	\frac{a_{5s}}{2} 
\end{align}
Therefore the total hyperfine interactionHamiltonian can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s}
							\begin{pmatrix}
								0	&	0							&	0							&	0	\\ 
								0	&	0							&	\sqrt{I\left(I+1\right)}	&	0	\\ 
								0	&	\sqrt{I\left(I+1\right)}	&	-1							&	0	\\ 
								0	&	0							&	0							&	0
							\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
It's clear that, for \Sr{87}, only the states with $F = I = {9}/{2}$ are mixed whereas the $F = I + 1 = {11}/{2}$ and $F = I - 1 = {7}/{2}$ states are left unperturbed. 

\subsection{Singly Excited $\SLJ{}{D}{}$ State Hyperfine Mixing Matrix}

A procedure similar to the one used to derive the $\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}$ matrix elements for singly excited $\SLJ{}{S}{}$ states can be applied to obtain $\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}$ for the singly excited $\SLJ{}{D}{}$ states but the process is quite a bit more difficult. 
Starting from the $LS$-coupled states, there are $\num{20}$ states spread across the various $\ket*{\nSLJM{5snd}{1}{D}{2}{m_J}}$, $\ket*{\nSLJM{5snd}{3}{D}{1}{m_J}}$, $\ket*{\nSLJM{5snd}{3}{D}{2}{m_J}}$, and $\ket*{\nSLJM{5snd}{3}{D}{3}{m_J}}$ sublevels. 
Coupling to the $2 I + 1 = 2{9}/{2} = 10$ nuclear spin states in \Sr{87} results in a total of $\num{200}$ states which can be coupled by $\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}$. 
This is even before including mixing between the various $\SLJ{}{D}{}$ states \cite{Esherick1977.PRA.15.1920, Beigang1982.JPB.15.L201, Sun1989.JPB.22.2887}.
Therefore, the reader is referred to \cite{Sun1989.JPB.22.2887} which provides a summary of calculating $\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}$ for the singly excited $\SLJ{}{D}{}$ states and \cite{Lurio1962.PR.126.1758} which provides analytical matrix elements of $\hat{V}_{\text{hf}}$ for two electrons in an $sl$ configuration.

\subsection{Semiclassical Evaluation of Radial Wave Functions Overlap Integral ($O_{n,n'}$)}

*********** Following the method outlined in \cite{Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}

At higher $n$, the hyperfine shift becomes comparable to the splitting between $n$ and $n^{\prime} = n \pm 1$ as seen in \cref{fig:deltaE,fig:n-scaling}. 
Hyperfine-induced $n$-mixing was experimentally observed around $n = \num{113}$ between the $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}$ and $\nSLJf{5s\qty(n+1)s}{3}{S}{1}{9/2}$ states \cite{Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}.

The derivation above can be extended to incorporate $n$-mixing. 
Using the fact that $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ only couples states with the same $F$ and the orthogonality of the radial wave functions for states of same spin multiplet but different $n$, the diagonal matrix elements of $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ for $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I+1}$ and $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I-1}$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5sn^{\prime}s}{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} I \delta_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5sn^{\prime}s}{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(I+1) \delta_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
The off-diagonal elements vanish between these states because they remain uncoupled.


****** I don't think I can do this ``expansion''... I think I want to just calculate matrix elements between n and n' states ******
On the other hand, because $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ mixes the $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}$ and $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}$ states, we can write
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}}	{}={}&	\ket{\nSLJf{n}{1}{S}{0}{I}} + \sum_{n^{\prime}}{\ket{\nSLJf{n^{\prime}}{3}{S}{1}{I}}}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}}	{}={}&	\ket{\nSLJf{n}{3}{S}{1}{I}} + \sum_{n^{\prime}}{\ket{\nSLJf{n^{\prime}}{1}{S}{0}{I}}}
\end{align}
where $\nSLJf{n}{1}{S}{0}{I}$ and $\nSLJf{n}{3}{S}{1}{I}$ represent pure singly-excited singlet and triplet $F=I$ states (recalling that the radial wave functions are orthogonal for $n \neq n^{\prime}$ for states in the same spin multiplet).
Calculating the matrix elements of $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ between $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}$ and $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}$ gives
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5s{n^\prime}s}{1}{S}{0}{I}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5s{n^\prime}s}{3}{S}{1}{I}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \delta_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
The off-diagonal elements can be expressed as
\begin{align}
	\mel{\nSLJf{5s{n^\prime}s}{1}{S}{0}{I}}{\hat{V}_\text{hf}}{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{I}}
		{}={}&	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} (stuff to finish deriving)	\notag	\\
		{}={}&	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \sqrt{I \qty(I+1)} O_{n,n^{\prime}}
\end{align}
where $O_{n,n^{\prime}}$ is the overlap between the singlet and triplet radial wave functions which can be estimated semiclassically \cite{Bhatti1981.PRA.24.161, Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}
\begin{equation}
	O_{n_{1},n_{2}}
		=	\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{n_{2}^{*}}
		=	\qty(-1)^{n_{2}-n_{1}} \frac{2 \sqrt{n_{1}^{*} n_{2}^{*}}}{n_{1}^{*} + n_{2}^{*}} \frac{\sin[\pi \qty(n_{2}^{*} - n_{1}^{*})]}{\pi \qty(n_{2}^{*} - n_{1}^{*})}
\end{equation}

		Semiclassical estimation of the radial wave function overlap \cite{Bhatti1981.PRA.24.161} between $\nSLJ{n}{1}{S}{0}$ and $\nSLJ{n^{\prime}}{3}{S}{1}$ states ($O_{n,n^{\prime}}$) for $n^{\prime}=n, n+1, n+2$.}
\end{figure}

Between adjacent $n$ (i.e., for $n_{2} = n_{1} + 1$) and $\delta_{2} \neq \delta_{1}$, the approximation reduces to
\begin{equation}
	O_{n_{1},n_{1}+1}
		=	\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}}
		=	-\frac{2 \sqrt{n_{1}^{*} \qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}}}{n_{1}^{*} + \qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}} \frac{\sin[\pi \qty(\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*} - n_{1}^{*})]}{\pi \qty(\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*} - n_{1}^{*})}
\end{equation}
Since the $\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}$ state is always higher in energy than the $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{9/2}$, they should cross when $n_{1}$ corresponds to the singlet state and $n_{2} = n_{1} + 1$ corresponds to the triplet state. 
Using the quantum defects from \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004}, we expect $\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}} \approx \num{0.1}$ and $\braket{n_{1}^{*}}{\qty(n_{1}+1)^{*}} \approx \num{0.05}$ so we only include $n$ and $n+1$ mixing.

As see in \cref{fig:semiclassical_overlap}, the strongest $n$-mixing occurs for $\Delta n = \pm 1$ with $O_{n,n^{\prime}} \approx \num{0.1}$ and quickly drops off for larger $\Delta n$.

\subsection{Calibration of the EXFO WA-1500 Wavemeter}

All light used in the calibration measurements were delivered to the EXFO WA-1500 wavemeter using single mode (SM) optical fibers\footnote{Thorlabs SM600 FC/PC single mode fiber.}.
We had previously used a multimode fiber but found that the wavemeter readings were inconsistent, most likely due to the speckle output pattern or to slight beam pointing deviations.
Switching to a SM fiber alleviated these issue and we were able to consistently obtain wavenumber measurements limited by the resolution of the wavenumber with a statistical uncertainty of about $\sigma_{\text{stat}} = \pm \SI{0.0005}{\per\cm} = \pm \SI{15}{MHz}$ for the wavelengths we measured. Since the $\SI{319}{\nm}$ light is generated by frequency-doubling from $\SI{638}{\nm}$, the statistical uncertainty is should be doubled as well to about $\sigma_{\text{stat}} = \pm \SI{0.001}{\per\cm} = \pm \SI{30}{MHz}$.

Since the wavemeter is used to determine the absolute energy of the $\SI{638}{\nm}$ photon, potential systematic offsets also needed to be characterized. 
We initially attempted to perform Doppler-free spectroscopy of molecular iodine ({\tsup{127}I\tsub{2}}) using the ${P65~\left(7–4\right)}$ line at \SI{15672.517398(25)}{\per\cm} \cite{Sansonetti1997.JOSAB.14.1913}, which is near the ($\SI{638}{\nm}$) wavelength required to excite the $\nSLJ{5s40s}{3}{S}{1}$ strontium Rydberg state, but were unable to observe narrow Doppler-free signals scanning the $\SI{638}{\nm}$ laser through a our iodine cell using a simple saturated absorption setup\footnote{This matches similar experiences according to Jason Nguyen and Henry Luo in the Hulet lab when they were considering using an iodine cell to lock their $\SI{646}{\nm}$ laser for a \Li{6} UV MOT \cite{Duarte2011.PRA.84.061406}.}.
A longer cell and a more sensitive detection method may be necessary since most reported {\tsup{127}I\tsub{2}} spectroscopy setups in this wavelength range used cells longer than $\SI{30}{\cm}$ in addition implementing some sort of modulation spectroscopy to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., \cite{Sansonetti1997.JOSAB.14.1913, Huang2018.AO.57.2102, Onishchenko2019.PRA.99.052503}).
Since the publication of our paper, the Weidem{\"{u}}ller group was able to calibrate their wavemeter with Doppler-free iodine spectroscopy for measurements of the $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$, $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{1}$, and $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{2}$ Rydberg energies in \Sr{88} \cite{Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503}.

Although the iodine spectroscopy didn't work out, we were able to calibrate the wavemeter by measuring wavelengths of lasers lock to atomic transitions in \Sr{88} ($\SI{689}{\nm}$) and \Li{6} ($\SI{671}{\nm}$ and $\SI{646}{\nm}$).
The $\SI{689}{\nm}$ reference comes from the red master laser locked to the $\SLJ{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \SLJ{3}{P}{1}$ in \Sr{88}.
Ya-Ting Chang, Danyel Cavazos, and Dr. Randy Hulet were kind enough to let us run a fiber\footnote{Also a Thorlabs SM600 SM fiber.} between the Killian and Hulet labs in order to measure the wavelengths of their $\SI{671}{\nm}$ and $\SI{646}{\nm}$ lasers for laser cooling \Li{6}.
The $\SI{671}{\nm}$ is used for a standard $D_{2}$ MOT while the $\SI{646}{\nm}$ is frequency doubled to $\SI{323}{\nm}$ for a UV MOT \cite{Duarte2011.PRA.84.061406}.
The long fiber was required so that the EXFO WA-1500 could be calibrated in-place under similar conditions as when measuring Rydberg energies. 
In addition to keeping the wavemeter in-place, the wavelength calibratoin measurements were performed within about $\SI{2}{\hour}$ to reduce sensitivity to environmental changes.

Comparing the quantum defects reported in \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004, Jackson2018.PhD, Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503}, which were obtained from measurements in \Sr{88}, to those extracted from the $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{{11}/{2}}$ in \Sr{87} generally shows good agreement.

The \Sr{88} quantum defects were extracted from the reported Rydberg energies using the Rydberg formula \cref{eq:ene0} with the most recently reported ionization limit $E^{\pqty*{0}}_{\text{ion}} = \SI{45932.20024+-0.00033}{\per\cm}$ \cite{Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503} and the mass-scaled Rydberg constant $R\pqty*{m_{88}} = \SI{109736.6308675+-0.0000007}{\per\cm}$ (see \cref{sec:rydberg_properties}).
Quantum defects from the \Sr{87} data were obtained by first subtracting the calculated hyperfine energy shift to obtain an $I = 0$ Rydberg state energy, and then applying \cref{eq:ene0} with the Rydberg constant $R\pqty*{m_{88}} = \SI{109736.6230135+-0.0000007}{\per\cm}$ and ionization limit $E^{\pqty*{0}}_{\text{ion}} = \SI{45932.1956}{\per\cm}$ appropriate for \Sr{87}.

\section{Conclusion}

******************

Although the hyperfine interaction complicates the Rydberg spectra of \Sr{87}, it does offer some interesting possibilities. 
One possibility is to access Rydberg states with either attractive ($\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{S}{0}$) or repulsive ($\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$) $C_{6}$ coefficients \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004} from the $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ intermediate due to the hyperfine mixing.

\section{Hyperfine Rydberg States of \Sr{87}}

Accurate \textit{ab initio} theoretical descriptions of the Rydberg structure of multielectron atoms is currently challenging due to the interaction of the Rydberg electron with the ionic core. 
This interplay may lead to different configurations (``channels'') of the Rydberg electron and the ionic core which share the same total energy, angular momentum, and parity \cite{Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}.
When the ionic states are not well-separated from the Rydberg states, multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) is the commonly used method for analyzing the Rydberg states of these multielectron atoms which can describe the Rydberg state in terms of a few parameters \cite{Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Aymar1996.RMP.68.1015, Robicheaux2018.PRA.97.022508}\footnote{I think \cite{Cooke1985.PRA.32.2725}, referenced and followed by \cite{Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms}, would probably be a good paper to work through as they provide an example calculation.}. 

Focusing on two-electron systems (e.g., {\tsup{3}\text{He}}, {\tsup{9}\text{Be}}, {\tsup{25}\text{Mg}}, {\tsup{43}\text{Ca}}, \Sr{87}, {\tsup{135}\text{Ba}}, {\tsup{137}\text{Ba}}), we follow the approach adopted in \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496, Beigang1983.PRL.51.771, Beigang1988.JOSAB.5.2423} and separate the total Hamiltonian for the system in to a part which does not depend on the nuclear spin ($\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}$) and the hyperfine interaction ($\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}$) which does depend on the nuclear spin
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}^{I \neq 0} = \hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0} + \hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}
\end{equation}
$\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}}$ contains the effects up to the fine structure level. 
The convenience of separating out the $\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}$ term becomes apparent because the eigenenergies (up to the fine structure level) can be obtained from the Rydberg-Ritz formula
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rydberg-ritz}
	\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0}}	=	E_{\text{ion}} - \frac{R}{\pqty{n - \mu_{n,L,S,J}}^{2}}
\end{equation}
with the quantum defect given by \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440, Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004}\footnote{** There's an interesting discussion on how the equation for quantum defect is supposed to be recursive with $n^{*} = n - \delta\pqty{n^{*}} = n - \delta_{0} - \delta_{2}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{2} - \delta_{4}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{4} - \cdots$ \cite{Drake1991.PRA.44.5448} vs. the power-series expansion presented in \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440} **.}
\begin{equation}
	\mu_{n,L,S,J}	=	\mu_{0} + \frac{\mu_{2}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{2}} + \frac{\mu_{4}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{4}} + \cdots
\end{equation}
Therefore, we only need to evaluate $\ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}$ to obtain the hyperfine shifts.

The hyperfine interaction can be expressed as \cite{Woodgate.Elementary, Sobelman.Atomic, Bransden.Atoms}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_\text{hfs}	=	A \hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{J}}
						=	\sum_{i} A_{i} \hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{j}}_{i}
						=	\sum_{i} A_{i} \hat{\va{I}} \cdot \pqty{\hat{\va{l}}_{i} + \hat{\va{s}}_{i}}
\end{equation}
for electron $i \in \Bqty{1,2}$ with the (magnetic dipole) hyperfine constant $A$.
Therefore the contribution of each electron to the total hyperfine shift is
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{i}	=	A_{i} \ev*{\hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{j}}_{i}}
									=	\frac{A_{i}}{2} \bqty{f_{i} \pqty{f_{i} + 1} - I \pqty{I + 1} - j_{i} \pqty{j_{i} + 1}}
\end{equation}
We now consider a singly-excited Rydberg states where the ``inner'' electron in the $\ket{m s}$ state (i.e., an $s$ electron in the ground state of the ion) and the ``outer'' Rydberg electron in a $\ket{n \ell}$ state.
*** I don't really like this sudden transition.... ***
Recalling that the $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{i} \sim {1}/{n^{3}}$ ** \cite{Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725, Sobelman.Atomic, Bransden.Atoms} **, it follows that for high-$n$ Rydberg states, the $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{i}$ can be approximated as
\begin{align}
	\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{\text{inner}}	&{}={}	A_{\text{inner}} \ev*{\hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{s}}_{\text{inner}}}	\\
	\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{\text{outer}}	&{}={}	A_{\text{outer}} \ev*{\hat{\va{I}} \cdot \hat{\va{s}}_{\text{outer}}}	\approx	0
\end{align}
Since the ``outer'' electron does not significantly contribute to $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}$, it follows that $\ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}} \simeq \ev*{\hat{V}_\text{hfs}}_{\text{inner}}$.
Here, $A_{\text{inner}}$ is taken to be ** ? ** as the same value as $A$ in the $\nSLJ{5s}{2}{S}{1/2}$ state of \Srion{87}{+}.

Combining the above results, we can write the expected energies of the hyperfine Rydberg levels of isotopes with $I \neq 0$ as a shift from the ``unperturbed'' levels in an isotope with $I = 0$.

*** I need to come up with a better derivation.... I went down a bit of a rabbit hole above... ***

\subsection{Singly Excited $S$ states}

The calculation for the hyperfine shifts of singly excited $S$ Rydberg states is not too difficult with most of the details worked out in \cref{sec:hyperfine_mixing_derivation}. 
It can be shown that the four hyperfine basis states are $\ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}$, $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}$, $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}$, and $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}$.
Using these basis states, we can evaluate the matrix elements of the hyperfine interaction and find that only the $F = I$ states interact with the matrix elements \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496}
\begin{align}
	\bra{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	&{}={}	0										\\
	\bra{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	&{}={}	\frac{a_{ms}}{2} \sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	\\
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	&{}={}	\frac{a_{ms}}{2} \sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	\\
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hfs} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	&{}={}	-\frac{a_{ms}}{2} 
\end{align}
Therefore, $\hat{H}^{I \neq 0}$ for the interacting $F = I$ states is
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}^{I \neq 0}	=	\hat{H}^{I = 0} + \hat{V}_\text{hfs}
						=	\begin{pmatrix}
								E_{\SLJ{1}{S}{0}}	&	0					\\ 
								0					&	E_{\SLJ{3}{S}{1}}
							\end{pmatrix}
						+	\frac{a_{ms}}{2}
							\begin{pmatrix}
								0					&	\sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	\\ 
								\sqrt{I \pqty{I+1}}	&	-1
							\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
As mentioned previously, $E_{\SLJ{1}{S}{0}}$ and $E_{\SLJ{3}{S}{1}}$ can be obtained from \cref{eq:rydberg-ritz} with the appropriate quantum defects for each series.

For singly excited Rydberg states $\ket{\nSLJM{5snl}{2S+1}{L}{J}{m_J}}_{J}$ with the ``inner'' electron in the $\ket{5s}$ state and the Rydberg electron in the $\ket{nl}$ state, the symmetric ($+$) and antisymmetric ($-$) orbital wave functions can be written as $\ket{L,m_L}_{L\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{ms;nl,m_L}\pm\ket{nl;ms,m_L}\right)$.
Combining the orbital and spin wave functions for singlet and triplet states are
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJM{msnl}{1}{L}{J}{m_J}}_{J}	&{}={}	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{ms;nl,m_L}+\ket{nl;ms,m_L}\right) \ket{0,0}_{S}	\notag	\\
											&{}={}	\ket{L,m_L=m_J}_{L+} \ket{0,0}_{S}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJM{msnl}{3}{L}{J}{m_J}}_{J}	&{}={}	\sum_{m_L} \sum_{m_S} \CG{L,m_L}{1,m_S}{J,m_J} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{ms;nl,m_L}-\ket{nl;ms,m_L}\right) \ket{1,m_S}_{S}	\notag	\\
											&{}={}	\sum_{m_S} \CG{L,m_L}{1,m_S}{J,m_J} \ket{L,m_L=m_J-m_S}_{L-} \ket{1,m_S}_{S}
\end{align}
with the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients defined as $\CG{J_1,M_1}{J_2,M_2}{J,M}=\braket{J_1,M_1;J_2,M_2}{J,M}$.



***************

For singly-excited $S$ Rydberg states in strontium with the `inner'' electron in the $\ket{5 s}$ state and the ``outer'' electron in the $\ket{n \ell}$ state, the singlet and triplet basis states can be written as
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{0}}	&{}={}	\frac{1}{2} \pqty{\ket{5s}\ket{ns} + \ket{}} \pqty{\ket{} - \ket{}}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{1}}	&{}={}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{0}}	&{}={}	\\
	\ket{\nSLJm{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{-1}}	&{}={}
\end{align}


***************

For singly-excited states, the hyperfine interaction of the ``outer'' electron with the core should scale as **$\sim 1/n^3$ \cite{Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725}? ** and should be negligible for high-lying states. 
We make the assumption that $\hat{V}_\text{hf} \simeq a_{ms} \hat{\bm{s}}_{\text{in}} \cdot \hat{\bm{I}}$ for singly-excited Rydberg states with inner electron $\ket{ms}$ and Rydberg electron $\ket{nl}$.
Expanding $\hat{\bm{s}}_\text{in}$ and $\hat{\bm{I}}$ in terms of ladder operators gives
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:V_hf}
	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \simeq \frac{a_{ms}}{2} \left(\hat{s}_{\text{in},+} \hat{I}_{-} + \hat{s}_{\text{in},-} \hat{I}_{+} + 2\hat{s}_{\text{in},z} \hat{I}_{z}\right)
\end{equation}
with the usual ladder operators $\hat{J}_{\pm}=\hat{J}_{x} \pm \hat{J}_{y}$. 
Note that $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ leaves the total spin $m_F$ unchanged, meaning it couples states of the same $m_F$. 

For a singly-excited Rydberg state where the Rydberg electron is in the $\ket{n \ell}$ state while the inner electron remains in the $\ket{m s}$ state, the Hamiltonian can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \pqty{\hat{H}_{0} + \hat{H}_{\text{fs}} + \zeta_{nl} \hat{\va{s}} \vdot \hat{\va{l}}} + a_{ms} \hat{\va{s}} \vdot \hat{\va{I}}
\end{equation}
where $\zeta_{nl}$ is the magnitude of the spin-orbit interaction (of the Rydberg electron), and $a_{ms}$ is the strength of the hyperfine interaction of the inner $s$ electron. 
Making the assumption that the terms $\pqty{\cdots}$ are the same for all isotopes, then the remaining hyperfine shift is simply due to the contact interaction between the remaining $ms$ electron and the ion.
This allows us to leverage the simpler spectroscopic data of the bosonic isotopes from which we can deduce the eigenstates and eigenenergies of an assumed $I = 0$ atom before incorporating isotope-specific hyperfine interactions.
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}^{I \neq 0}	=	\hat{H}_{0}^{I = 0} \pqty{m_{I = 0}, m_{I \neq 0}} + \hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian that yields the eigenstates and eigenenergies, for \Sr{88} but scaled by the reduced mass $m_{87} = \flatfrac{m_{e} M_{87}}{\pqty{m_{e} + M_{87}}}$. $\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}$ is the hyperfine interaction, $m_{e}$ the electron mass and $M_{87}$ the mass of the \Srion{87}{+} ion.

Focusing on strontium, corrections beyond the elementary isotope shift, in particular, the mass polarization correction, was estimated from earlier data for helium Rydberg states \cite{Cok1979.PRA.19.1830, Cok1981.PRA.24.3283, vanderVeldt1990.PRA.41.4099} and are expected to be $\lesssim \SI{1}{\MHz}$ and are neglected.
Under this assumption, the energies of the \Sr{87} Rydberg states should be given by
\begin{equation}
	\ev*{\hat{H}^{87}}	=	\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}} + \ev*{\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}}
\end{equation}
The values of $\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}}$ are easily determined from the Rydberg-Ritz formula
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rydberg-ritz}
	\ev*{\hat{H}^{87}}	=	\ev*{\hat{H}_{0}^{88} \pqty{m_{88}, m_{87}}}
						=	E^{87}_{\text{ion}} - \frac{R^{87}_{\text{Sr}}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{n,L,S,J}}^{2}}
\end{equation}
with the quantum defect given by ** \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440, Gallagher1994.RydbergAtoms, Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004} cite just Gallagher and Vaillant paper? **
\begin{equation}
	\mu_{n,L,S,J}	=	\mu_{0} + \frac{\mu_{2}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{2}} + \frac{\mu_{4}}{\pqty{n - \mu_{0}^{2}}^{4}}
\end{equation}
** Use footnote? There's an interesting discussion on how the equation for quantum defect is supposed to be recursive with $n^{*} = n - \delta\pqty{n^{*}} = n - \delta_{0} - \delta_{2}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{2} - \delta_{4}/\pqty{n - \delta}^{4} - \cdots$ \cite{Drake1991.PRA.44.5448} vs. the power-series expansion presented in \cite{Gentile1990.PRA.42.440}. **

An important consideration in determining when effects cannot be neglected is when the energy scales become comparable.
For tstrontium, the energy scale of the hyperfine interaction is given by $a_{5s}$ and, as $n$ increases this energy scale becomes comparable.
As seen in \cref{fig:n-scaling}, it first becomes comparable to the fine structure splitting, then the singlet-triplet splitting, then the Coulomb splitting.
*** MOVED FIGURE ***
From \cref{fig:n-scaling}, one would also expect hyperfine mixing to occur between $n \sim 10$ and $n \sim 20$ which was indeed observed \cite{Beigang1981.PRL.47.326, Beigang1982.PRL.48.290, Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}.
Hyperfine mixing was also observed between the $\nSLJ{5s19d}{1}{D}{2}$ and $\nSLJ{5s19d}{3}{D}{3}$ states \cite{Beigang1982.JPB.15.L201}.

%\subsection{Singly Excited $S$ states}

In the below, we follow the derivation outlined in \cite{Beigang1982.PRA.25.1496,Beigang1983.PRL.51.771}.
A more detailed derivation is provided in \cref{sec:hyperfine_mixing_derivation} where it is shown that $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ only mixes states of the same $F$.
** I need to actually do the derivation.... **

Assuming there are no perturbing states, a reasonable assumption for $n \gtrsim 12$ for the both the $\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{S}{0}$ and $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{S}{1}$ Rydberg series \cite{Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}, we start with the pure singly-excited singlet $\ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}$ and triplet $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}$, $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}$, and $\ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}$ hyperfine states.
Applying $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ to these basis states gives
\begin{align}
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} I \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	\\
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \sqrt{I\qty(I+1)} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	\\
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(\sqrt{I\qty(I+1)} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} - \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}})	\\
	&	\hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(I+1) \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}
\end{align}
From the above, it's apparent that the unmixed states have energy shifts
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I+1}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} I			\approx	\SI{-2.25}{\GHz}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I-1}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \qty(I+1)	\approx	\SI{2.75}{\GHz}
\end{equation}
The matrix elements of the mixed $F=I$ states are
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}}	=	-\frac{1}{2} a_{5s}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\SLJf{3}{S}{1}{I}} \hat{V}_\text{hf} \ket{\SLJf{1}{S}{0}{I}}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s} \sqrt{I\qty(I+1)}
\end{equation}
Therefore $F=I$ submatrix of the block-diagonal $\hat{V}_\text{hf}$ matrix can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V}_\text{hf}	=	\frac{1}{2} a_{5s}
							\begin{pmatrix}
								0							& \sqrt{I\left(I+1\right)}	\\ 
								\sqrt{I\left(I+1\right)}	& -1						\\ 
							\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Diagonalizing the total Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}_\text{hf}$ gives the eigenenergies
\begin{equation}
	E^{\pm}	=	\frac{E_{1}+E_{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{4} a_{5s} \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\qty(E_{1}-E_{3})^2 + a_{5s} \qty(E_{1}-E_{3}) + a_{5s}^{2} \qty(I + \frac{1}{2})^2}
\end{equation}
Taking the limit $a_{5s} \rightarrow 0$ (i.e., no hyperfine interaction), we observe $E^{+} \rightarrow E\qty(\SLJ{1}{S}{0})$ and $E^{-} \rightarrow E\qty(\SLJ{3}{S}{1})$ meaning $E^{+}$ corresponds to the energy of $\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}}$ and $E^{+}$ corresponds to energy of $\ket{\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{9/2}}$.

\subsection{Singly Excited $D$ states}

Even before including hyperfine interactions, the spin-orbit interactions leads to a breakdown of $LS$ coupling and mixes the $\SLJ{1}{D}{2}$ and $\SLJ{3}{D}{2}$ states and is especially strong around $n = \num{15}$ where they swap singlet and triplet character \cite{Esherick1977.PRA.15.1920, Beigang1981.PRL.47.326, Beigang1982.PRL.48.290, Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725, Vaillant2014.JPB.47.155001}.
To account for this mixing, the eigenstates $\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{D}{2}$ and $\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{D}{2}$ of the $H_{0}\qty(88, m_{87})$ are expanded as
\begin{align}
	\ket{\nSLJ{5sns}{1}{D}{2}}	&{}={}	\cos\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{1}{D}{2}} + \sin\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{3}{D}{2}} \\
	\ket{\nSLJ{5sns}{3}{D}{2}}	&{}={}	-\sin\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{1}{D}{2}} + \cos\theta\ket{\nSLJ{n}{3}{D}{2}}
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is the mixing angle \cite{Sun1989.JPB.22.2887} of the pure singlet $\ket{\nSLJ{n}{1}{D}{2}}$ and triplet $\ket{\nSLJ{n}{3}{D}{2}}$ states.
*** For higher $n$, the singlet-triplet mixing of the $\SLJ{1}{D}{2}$ and $\SLJ{3}{D}{2}$ states becomes nearly $n$ independent as evidenced by their quantum defects \cite{Vaillant2012.JPB.45.135004, Couturier2019.PRA.99.022503}. **
Calculations using a two-active-electron (TAE) model \cite{Ye2013.PRA.88.043430, Fields2018.PRA.97.013429} estimates that converges towards $\theta \sim \num{-0.16}$ for high $n$.
** Where does $\theta \sim \num{-0.14}$ come from? **

** See \cite{Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725} for a calculation of mixing coefficients? **

Calculating the hyperfine matrix elements of the $D$ states is quite a bit more challenging than for the $S$ states. 
In total, there are $\num{20}$ singly excited $D$ states ($\nSLJ{5snd}{1}{D}{2}$, $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{1}$, $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{2}$, and $\nSLJ{5snd}{3}{D}{3}$) which each have $2 I + 1 = 10$ nuclear spin states. 
The matrix elements of $\hat{V}_{\text{hfs}}$ can be evaluated analytically \cite{Lurio1962.PR.126.1758, Sun1989.JPB.22.2887, Gudde1993.PRA.47.4725}.

Due to these interactions, it's not clear how to assign the different states since $S$ and $J$ are no longer good quantum numbers. 
Instead, the state assignments were made by evaluating the overlap of the hyperfine-mixed states with the unperturbed $\nSLJ{5sns}{2S+1}{D}{J}$ state.
