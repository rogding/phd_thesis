\chapter{Progress Towards an \textit{In Situ} Measurement of $g^{\qty(3)}\qty(R)$}

Following up on the use of dimer ground state (${D}_{0}$) Rydberg molecules to measure $g^{\qty(2)}\qty(R)$, we followed up by looking at the trimer ground state Rydberg molecules (${Tr}_{00}$) to provide an \textit{in situ} probe of $g^{\qty(3)}\qty(R)$. 

\subsection{Correcting for density}

Knowing our trap frequencies and sample temperature, we should be well above the Fermi temperature $T_F$ meaning we should not be anywhere near quantum degeneracy.
As such, we treat the sample as thermal with a Gaussian density distribution. 
Therefore, the correction due to the three-body density distribution is found by calculating $\int\int\int \rho^{3}\qty(R)$.
** Check that this makes sense when considering interparticle separations vs. length scale of Rydberg molecule wave function? **

\section{Results}

The results are shown in \cref{fig:g3_results} show that ${Tr}_{00}$ exhibit an enhanced suppression in their excitation rate compared to $D_{0}$.

		Ratio of the polarized to unpolarized excitation rates of the dimers ${D}_{0}$ and trimers ${Tr}_{00}$.
		The $D_{0}$ data show good agreement with $g^{\qty(2)}\qty(R)$ calculated for $T \approx \SI{850}{\nano\K}$.}

\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated progress towards an \textit{in situ} measurement of $g^{\qty(3)}\qty(R)$.
