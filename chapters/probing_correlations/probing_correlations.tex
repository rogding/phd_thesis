\label{ch:correlations}

Many interesting phenomena in quantum systems have a length scale associated with their interaction.
Perhaps one of the most fundamental are the effects of either Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac statistics leading to the bunching or antibunching of particles \cite{Naraschewski1999.PRA.59.4595}.
Another interesting phenomena is the ``fermionization'' of strongly-interacting bosons in a one-dimensional gas \cite{Kinoshita2004.Science.305.1125}.
In these examples, the interactions affect the likelihood of finding another particle within a fixed distance., i.e., a spatial correlation.
As a result, tools that provide information regarding the spatial correlation in these systems are extremely insightful.

Perhaps one of the most ingenious ways of probing spatial correlations due to quantum statistics was demonstrated with metastable helium atoms.
By dropping both cold (but non-degenerate) and quantum degenerate Bose and Fermi gases on to a time-resolved position-sensitive MCP detector, the two-body and three-body pair correlation functions of the initial sample were able to be reconstructed \cite{Schellekens2005.Science.310.648, Jeltes2007.Nature.445.402, Hodgman2011.Science.331.1046}.
Although powerful, this method is neither \textit{in situ} nor nondestructive, requiring the samples to be at equilibrium prior to dropping in order for the reconstruction to make sense, thus hindering the possibility of mapping the temporal development of spatial correlations. 

Alternative, less destructive, \textit{in situ} techniques have also been developed and employed but these are generally restricted by the dimensionality of a system or the length scales accessible.
For the shortest length scales (i.e., $R = 0$ contact interactions), inelastic loss due to three-body recombination has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of $g^{\pqty*{3}}\pqty*{R}$ as evidenced by the different loss rates observed in a nondegenerate compared to a degenerate Bose gases \cite{Burt1997.PRL.79.337}. 
For length scales comparable to the sizes of molecular bonds (i.e., $R \sim R_{\text{vdW}} \lesssim \SI{10}{\nm}$), photoassociative spectroscopy (PAS) can be used 
since efficient photoassociation requires the constituent atoms to have a separation distance comparable to the molecular potential (the van der Waals $R_{\text{vdW}}$) \cite{Jones2006.RMP.78.483, Jones2006.RMP.78.1041}.
If the effect can be observed in a two (or one) dimensional lattice structure, quantum gas microscopes (QGM) have the capability of directly detecting the presence or absence of atoms on a particular lattice site and, therefore, are able to directly measure spatial correlations \cite{Bakr2010.Science.329.547, Omran2015.PRL.115.263001, Mazurenko2017.Nature.545.462}.
Since QGMs require an optical lattice, their accessible length scales are generally restricted by the wavelength of light used to form the lattice ($R \gtrsim \SI{266}{\nm}$).
\Cref{fig:correlation_tools} illustrates some of the tools developed for probing the effects and their typical effective length scales.

\end{figure}

As seen in \cref{fig:correlation_tools}, there is a gap for length scales $\SI{10}{\nm} \lesssim R \lesssim \SI{266}{\nm}$ which can be filled by ULRRMs. 
Analogous to how PAS can be used to probe correlations on the order of $R_{\text{vdW}}$, the formation rate of ULRRMs can also be used to measure spatial correlations. 
The advantage of ULRRMs is that the length scale being probed depends on the size of the parent Rydberg atom, meaning varying interparticle distances can be probed by simply exciting to a different principal quantum number ($n$). 
This tunability gives ULRRMs a huge advantage and can fill the gap between the short-range PAS and the longer-range $R \gtrsim \SI{266}{\nm}$ QGM.

\section{Probing of Spatial Correlations with ULRRMs}

In an ideal noninteracting gas, the atoms are expected to exhibit quantum statistical effects in their density distributions depending on whether they are bosonic, fermionic, or classical.
For the two-body case, this effect on the density distribution is typically referred to as the spatial correlation function ${g}^{\pqty*{2}}\pqty*{R}$ and can be written (for the ideal noninteracting case) as *** SOURCE? ***
\begin{equation}
	{g}^{\pqty{2}}\pqty{R}	=	1 + \epsilon {\me}^{-2 \pi R^{2}/{\lambda_{\text{dB}}}^{2}}
\end{equation}
where {$\epsilon = +1$, $-1$, and $0$} for bosons, fermions, and classical cases, respectively, and $\lambda_{\text{dB}} = {h}/{\sqrt{2 \pi m k_{B} T}}$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength.
For a more detailed discussion, see \cite{Naraschewski1999.PRA.59.4595}. **** OTHER REFERENCES? ****

It was shown in \cite{Whalen2019.PRA.100.011402} that the excitation rate of ULRRMs is sensitive to spatial correlations on length scales of the Rydberg electron orbital radius, i.e., $R \sim R_{n} \approx 2 \pqty*{n-\delta}^2$. 
In particular, the work was performed with the most deeply-bound vibrational ($\nu = 0$) dimer state which is spatially well-localized in the outer lobe of the Rydberg wave function as seen in \cref{fig:vary_n-nu0}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

The excitation probability of exciting a Rydberg molecule from an ultracold gas can be modeled similarly to photoassociation processes.
Shematic of the excitation process is shown in \cref{fig:ulrrm_photoassociation}.

		Figure adapted from \cite{Whalen2019.PRA.100.011402}.}
\end{figure}
Starting from a pair of colliding atoms, their scattering wave function can be written as $\ket*{\chi^{E}_{0}}$ where, well-outside the interatomic potential, can be described by free-particle state with $k = \sqrt{{2 \mu E}/{\hbar^2}}$.
(It is this scattering wave function which contains information about the symmetry of the initial states.)
Photoexcitation to a particular ULRRM state with wave function $\ket*{\chi_{n}^{\nu}}$ requires $\mathcal{F}_{n}^{\nu} = \bra*{\chi^{E}_{0}}\ket*{\chi_{n}^{\nu}}$ which can be thought of as a Franck-Condon factor.
Taking a thermal average over the collision energies of the initial two-particle states ($\ev*{\cdots}_{E}$) leads to
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:effective_fc}
	\ev{\abs{\mathcal{F}_{n}^{\nu}}^2}_{E}
		=	\ev{\abs{\bra{\chi^{E}_{0}}\ket{\chi_{n}^{\nu}}}^{2}}_{E}
		=	\ev{\abs{\int_{0}^{\infty} \dd{R} {R^2} \chi^{E}_{0}\pqty{R} \chi_{n}^{\nu}\pqty{R}}^2}_{E}
\end{equation}

As described in \cite{Whalen2019.PRA.100.011402}, due to the $\nu = 0$ state being well-localized around $R_{n}$, it can be approximated as $\chi_{n}^{\nu=0}\pqty*{R} \approx \delta\pqty*{R - R_n}$.
Evaluating \cref{eq:effective_fc} under this approximation gives\footnote{When evaluating \cref{eq:effective_fc_nu0}, it helps to notice that $\int_{0}^{\infty} \dd{R} {R^2} \chi^{E}_{0}\pqty*{R} A \delta\pqty*{R - R_n} = {R_n^2} \chi^{E}_{0}\pqty*{R_n} A = \chi^{E}_{0}\pqty*{R_n} \int_{0}^{\infty} \dd{R} {R^2} A \delta\pqty*{R-R_n}$.}
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:effective_fc_nu0}
	\ev{\abs{\mathcal{F}_{n}^{\nu=0}}^2}_{E}
		{}&=		\ev{\abs{\int_{0}^{\infty} \dd{R} {R^2} \chi^{E}_{0}\pqty{R} \chi_{n}^{\nu=0}\pqty{R}}^2}_{E}	\notag	\\
		{}&\approx	\ev{\abs{\chi^{E}_{0}\pqty{R_n}}^{2}}_{E} \abs{\int_{0}^{\infty} \dd{R} {R^2} \chi_{n}^{\nu=0}\pqty{R}}^2	\notag	\\
		{}&=		{g^{\pqty{2}}\pqty{R_n}} \abs{\int_{0}^{\infty} \dd{R} {R^2} \chi_{n}^{\nu=0}\pqty{R}}^2
\end{align}
where, in the last line, the relation $\ev*{\abs*{\chi^{E}_{0}\pqty*{R_n}}^{2}}_{E} = g^{\pqty*{2}}\pqty*{R_n}$ with $g^{\pqty*{2}}\pqty*{R_n}$ the pair-correlation function for separation $R_{n}$ was used. 
For the delocalized vibrational states ($\nu > 0$), the approximation $\chi_{n}^{\nu=0}\pqty{R} \approx \delta\pqty*{R_n}$ cannot be made and \cref{eq:effective_fc} must be evaluated with the full $\ket*{\chi_{n}^{\nu}}$ wave function.

\section{Experimental Procedure}

The experimental procedures used for the following experiments are similar to the one presented in \cite{Whalen2019.PRA.100.011402} and so will only be briefly covered.
The production of cold gases of both spin-polarized and unpolarized \Sr{87} begins by loading \Sr{87} and \Sr{84} in to the magnetic trap.
As described in \cref{ssec:magnetic_trap_and_repumping}, both isotopes are loaded by sequentially operating a blue MOT on the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{1}{P}{1}$ transition at $\SI{461}{\nm}$ for one isotope before changing to the second isotope.
The magnetic trap is populated with atoms following the weak $\nSLJ{5s5p}{1}{P}{1} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s4d}{1}{D}{2} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{2}$ decay path.
After the atoms are collected in the metastable reservoir, both isotopes are repumped with a pulse of $\SI{481}{\nm}$ light resonant with the $\nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{2} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5p^2}{3}{P}{2}$ transition and second-stage narrow line laser cooling proceeds simultaneously for both isotopes on the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ transition at $\SI{689}{\nm}$.
After narrow line cooling, both isotopes are loaded in to the ODT with a temperature of about $\SI{2}{\micro\kelvin}$ at which point the cooling light is extinguished.

After laser cooling and ODT loading, sample preparation for the spin-polarized and unpolarized gases differ slightly.
For the unpolarized sample, the atoms are held in the ODT for a short period of time to allow for free-evaporation before starting forced evaporation.
For the spin-polarized sample, an approximately $\SI{7}{\gauss}$ magnetic bias field is ramped on during the free-evaporation hold, providing both a quantization axis and Zeeman splitting the $\nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{{9}/{2}}$ states by approximately $\SI{600}{\kHz}$ per $m_F$. 
Spin-polarization is achieved by optically pumping on the $\nSLJf{5s^2}{1}{S}{0}{{9}/{2}} \rightarrow \nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{{9}/{2}}$ transition, individually driving each ${\Delta}m_{F} = +1$ with $\sigma^{+}$-polarized $\SI{689}{\nm}$ light. 
As seen in \cref{fig:pol_vs_unpol_spectra}, we achieve $\SI{> 90}{\percent}$ population in the $\nSLJfm{5s^2}{1}{S}{0}{{9}/{2}}{{9}/{2}}$ state.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}
Forced evaporation is performed after spin-polarization and the bias magnetic field is ramped down to about $\SI{1}{\gauss}$. 
After evaporation, both the spin-polarized and unpolarized samples are at about $\SI{900}{\nano\kelvin}$.
Prior to Rydberg excitation, a pulse of $\SI{689}{\nm}$ light resonant with the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ transition in \Sr{84} is applied to remove the isotope from the ODT.

% \subsection{Spin-Polarization of \Sr{87}}

% In order to realize a fermionic sample, we spin-polarize the \Sr{87} atoms in to the $\nSLJfm{5s^2}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}{9/2}$ state after loading in to the ODT. 
% Once the unpolarized \Sr{87} atoms are loaded in to the ODT, we apply a bias magnetic field of about $\SI{7}{\gauss}$.
% Spin-polarization is achieved by driving the $\nSLJf{5s^2}{1}{S}{0}{9/2} \rightarrow \nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{S}{1}{9/2}$ transition with each $m_F$ state separated by about $\SI{600}{\kHz}$. 
% Using ${\sigma}^{+}$ light, we sequentially drive ${\Delta}m_F=+1$ transitions from $m_F=-{9}/{2}$ to $m_F={7}/{2}$ with $\SI{45}{\ms}$ pulses.
% A last $\SI{500}{\ms}$ ``clean-up'' pulse driving the $m_F={7}/{2} \rightarrow m_{F}^{\prime}={9}/{2}$ helps produce a sample with better than $\SI{90}{\percent}$ population in the $\nSLJfm{5s^2}{1}{S}{0}{9/2}{9/2}$ state.

		% Checking that linear-linear spectroscopy does not significantly alter our population.}
% \end{figure}

% Before performing Rydberg excitation, we reduce the bias field to about $\SI{1.2}{\gauss}$. 

% \subsubsection{Evaluation of Spin-Polarization}

% The effectiveness of spin-polarization was evaluated by performing ``linear-linear'' two-photon Rydberg spectroscopy. 
% Crossed-polarized excitation beams travel perpendicular to the bias field with the UV beam driving $\pi$-transitions. 
% In this setup, the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ drives $\nSLJf{5s^2}{1}{S}{0}{9/2} \rightarrow \nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{9/2}$ and the $\SI{320}{\nm}$ drives $\nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{9/2} \rightarrow \nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{11/2}$.

		% Checking that linear-linear spectroscopy does not significantly alter our population.}
% \end{figure}

With the exception of the $\SI{\approx 1}{\gauss}$ magnetic bias field to maintain spin-polarization (no bias field is applied to the unpolarized sample), both the polarized and unpolarized gases follow the same two-photon Rydberg excitation scheme.
The first photon is at $\SI{689}{\nm}$ with $\sigma^{+}$-polarization and is blue-detuned from the intermediate $\nSLJf{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{{11}/{2}}$ state by about $\SI{14.8}{\MHz}$.
The second photon is at $\SI{320}{\nm}$ with $\pi$-polarization and is tuned to excite ULRRMs of the parent $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{{11}/{2}}$ Rydberg state.
Excitation powers were kept low to avoid saturating the MCP so signal-to-noise was increased by performing $\num{1000}$ excitation and detection cycles on a sample before a new sample is prepared and the frequency of the $\SI{320}{\nm}$ laser changed.
During Rydberg excitation, the ODT is turned off to eliminate AC Stark shifts before being turned back on after the field ionization and detection.
We keep our excitation rates low to avoid saturating the MCP.
After the Rydberg excitation pulses, a voltage ramp is applied to the in-vacuum electric field plates to ionize any Rydberg atoms or molecules formed and directs them towards the MCP and MCS system for detection and counting. 

\section{Spectroscopy of the $\nu=1$ and $\nu = 2$ ULRRM states}

Spectroscopy was performed by exciting $\nSLJf{5sns}{3}{S}{1}{{11}/{2}}$ ULRRMs for $n = \numrange[range-phrase=-]{31}{41}$.
In the experiment, the photoexcitation signal of the ULRRM dimers can be modeled as
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{S}_{n}^{\nu}\pqty{f}	=	\alpha I_{\SI{689}{\nm}} I_{\SI{320}{\nm}} \mathcal{N}_2 \beta_{n} \mathcal{C} \ev{\abs{\mathcal{F}_{n}^{\nu}}^2}_{E} L\pqty{f}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the detection efficiency, $I_{\SI{689}{\nm}}$ and $I_{\SI{320}{\nm}}$ are the intensities of the two-photon excitation lasers, $\beta_n$ is proportional to the square of the reduced two-photon electronic-transition matrix element, $\mathcal{N}_2 \equiv \int \dd[3]{r} \rho\pqty*{R}^2$ is the volume integral of the square of the density distribution, $\mathcal{C}$ is a Clebsch-Gordan factor, and $L\pqty{f}$ is a normalized lineshape factor as a function of frequency $f$.
To eliminate dependencies on the specific lineshape, the quantity of interest is the integrals of the observed excitation signal
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ulrrm_signal}
	\mathcal{S}_{n}^{\nu}
		=	\int \dd{f} \mathcal{S}_{n}^{\nu}\pqty{f}
		=	\alpha I_{\SI{689}{\nm}} I_{\SI{320}{\nm}} \mathcal{N}_2 \beta_{n} \mathcal{C} \ev{\abs{\mathcal{F}_{n}^{\nu}}^2}_{E}
\end{equation}
For a particular $n$, $\beta_{n}$ should remain the same for spin-polarized and unpolarized samples and the Clebsch-Gordan factor $\mathcal{C}$ can be calculated.
By monitoring the atom number, temperature, $I_{\SI{689}{\nm}}$, and $I_{\SI{320}{\nm}}$, some corrections can be applied to the observed signal to reduce potential systematics.

The first corrections applied to the raw signal involves accounting for any undercounting due to MCP saturation using the model in \cref{ssec:charged_particle_detection}).
Slow changes in the two-photon excitation rate are easily removed by dividing the signal by the $I_{\SI{689}{\nm}}$ and $I_{\SI{320}{\nm}}$ recorded on a DAQ\footnote{We actually record voltages $V_{\SI{689}{\nm}}$ and $V_{\SI{320}{\nm}}$ from monitor photodiodes which are proportional to $I_{\SI{689}{\nm}}$ and $I_{\SI{320}{\nm}}$, respectively.} for each measurement.
An example two-photon excitation spectra to the $\nSLJf{5s34s}{3}{S}{1}{{11}/{2}}$ parent Rydberg state of both a spin-polarized and an unpolarized \Sr{87} sample is shown in \cref{fig:processing_ULRRM_signal}, demonstrating the effects of removing dependencies on $I_{\SI{689}{\nm}}$, $I_{\SI{320}{\nm}}$, and MCP saturation.

\end{figure}
Fitting is performed on the scaled MCP signals to obtain the integrals of the particular ULRRM line of interest (represented by $\mathcal{S}_{n}^{\nu}$ in \cref{eq:ulrrm_signal}). 
Fitting the spectra in \cref{fig:processing_ULRRM_signal} is shown in \cref{fig:n34_fitted_dimers}.

\end{figure}
Before extracting the ratios, we can still determine the the density-dependent correction term $\mathcal{N}_{2}$ to reduce the effects of atom number and temperature variations for the different samples.
To make a comparison between spin-polarized and unpolarized signals, it would also be beneficial to determine the ratio ${\alpha_{\text{pol}}}/{\alpha_{\text{unpol}}}$.

\subsection{Density Correction Term}

During data collecting, both the atom number and sample temperature are recorded with resonant absorption imaging on the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{1}{P}{1}$ transition.
All the samples use the same final trapping parameters prior to Rydberg excitation with a vertical trap frequency of $f_{z} \approx \SI{300}{\Hz}$ and radial trap frequency of $f_{r} \approx \SI{130}{\Hz}$.
Knowing these parameters, we can apply a density-dependent correction to the ULRRM signals.

For a thermal gas in a three-dimensional harmonic trap, the density distribution is given by
\begin{equation}
	\rho\pqty{\va{r}}	=	\frac{N}{{\pi}^{3/2} R_{x} R_{y} R_{z}} {\me}^{-{x^2}/{R_x^2}} {\me}^{-{y^2}/{R_y^2}} {\me}^{-{z^2}/{R_z^2}}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the total atom number and $R_i^2 = {2 k_{B} T}/{m \omega_i^2}$ where $f_{i} = {\omega_i}/{2 \pi}$ is the trap frequency \cite{Pethick.BEC}. 
For the dimers, the total signal should be proportional to $\bqty*{\rho\pqty*{\va{r}}}^{2}$ integrated over all space.
Performing the integration yields
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{N}_2	=		\int \dd[3]{r} {\rho\pqty{\va{r}}}^2
					=		\frac{N^2}{{\pqty{2 \pi}^{3/2}} R_x R_y R_z}
					\propto	\frac{N^2}{T^{3/2}}
\end{equation}
Therefore, we can scale the measured signal by ${N^2}/{T^{3/2}}$ in order to account for the signal dependence on atom number and temperature. 
This correction is applied to all the dimer data.

\subsection{Electron Detection Efficiency Ratio ${\alpha_{\text{pol}}}/{\alpha_{\text{unpol}}}$}

The ratio ${\alpha_{\text{pol}}}/{\alpha_{\text{unpol}}}$ accounts for the differences in detection efficiency between the spin-polarized sample and unpolarized samples with the former measurements taken in a $B_{\text{pol}} \approx \SI{1}{\gauss}$ bias magnetic field oriented towards the MCP (to maintain spin-polarization) and the latter in no bias field ($B_{\text{unpol}} = \SI{0}{\gauss}$). 
Na{\"{i}}vely, after accounting for Clebsch-Gordan factors in the two-photon excitation, we expected the spin-polarized samples to exhibit a larger signal than the unpolarized sample simply due to the Lorentz force of the magnetic field, oriented towards the MCP, helping guide the electrons towards the detector.
Towards this end, we measured the two-photon excitation signals with \Sr{84} due to its simpler electronic structure in both $B_{\text{pol}}$ and $B_{\text{unpol}}$ configurations.

The measurements with \Sr{84} used the same beam paths and geometry as the measurements in \Sr{87}.
A two-photon excitation following two-photon excitation following the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s37s}{3}{S}{1}$ path was used.
The first photon is at $\SI{689}{\nm}$ with $\sigma^+$-polarization and is blue-detuned from the intermediate state by $\SI{14.9+-1}{\MHz}$.
The second photon is at $\SI{320}{\nm}$ with $\pi$-polarization and is tuned such that the two-photon energy is resonant with the Rydberg atom or molecule state.
\Cref{fig:detection_efficiency_vs_B} shows the spectra obtained with and without the bias magnetic field when $\SI{689}{\nm}$ is held fixed while the $\SI{320}{\nm}$ frequency is scanned. 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio, width=5in, height=\textheight]{probing_correlations/detection_efficiency_vs_B/B-field-set_points/detection_efficiency_vs_B.pdf}

		\label{fig:detection_efficiency_vs_B}
		The \Sr{84} $\nSLJ{5s37s}{3}{S}{1}$ atomic Rydberg line with $B_{\text{pol}} \approx \SI{1}{\gauss}$ (red circles) and $B_{\text{unpol}} \approx \SI{0}{\gauss}$ (blue squares) bias magnetic fields. 
		The MCP signal was scaled accounting for both the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ and $\SI{320}{\nm}$ powers while the atom number was constant for all the measurements.
		Gaussian fits (lines) were used to extract the integrals, resulting with $\mathcal{S}\pqty*{B_{\text{pol}}} = \num{369+-9}$ (red shaded region) and $\mathcal{S}\pqty*{B_{\text{unpol}}} = \num{278+-7}$ (blue shaded region).}
\end{figure}
As shown in the figure, $\mathcal{S}\pqty*{B_{\text{pol}}} = \num{369+-9}$ and $\mathcal{S}\pqty*{B_{\text{unpol}}} = \num{278+-7}$, their ratio gives ${\alpha\pqty*{B_{\text{pol}}}}/{\alpha\pqty*{B_{\text{unpol}}}} = \num{1.33+-0.05}$.

Before reporting a detection efficiency difference for the $B_{\text{pol}}$ and $ B_{\text{unpol}}$ conditions, there are still a few things to check and consider.
A possible source of systematic error in this determination of the ratio could be due to poor polarization of either (or both) the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ and $\SI{320}{\nm}$ excitation lasers. 
This seems unlikely as there is very little signal at $\Delta = 0$ when the the magnetic field is applied, suggesting that the polarizations are likely reasonably aligned to the quantization axis. 
This also matches our previous measurements checking spin-polarization which found the $\sigma^+$ beam path to have relatively good circular polarization.
The $\SI{320}{\nm}$ path passes through a high-extinction ratio calcite polarizer\footnote{Thorlabs' GLB10 Glan-Laser alpha-BBO calcite polarizer.} that cleans up the polarization.

Another thing to consider is that the Zeeman effect could change the intermediate detuning with the effect scaling as $\Gamma_{\text{sc}} \sim {1}/{\Delta^2}$.
From \cref{fig:detection_efficiency_vs_B}, the observed shift of the $\nSLJ{5s37s}{3}{S}{1}$ state with and without the magnetic field is $\SI{3.326+-0.006}{\MHz}$.
Since the $\nSLJ{5s37s}{3}{S}{1}$ state has $g_J = 2$, this corresponds to $B_{\text{pol}} = \SI{1.1882+-0.0020}{\gauss}$, which agrees with previous calibration measurements using the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJ{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}$ transition.
Considering the unpolarized intermediate state detuning $\Delta_{\text{unpol}} = \SI{14.9+-1}{\MHz}$, the polarized intermediate state detuning (from the $\nSLJ{5s^2}{1}{S}{0} \rightarrow \nSLJm{5s5p}{3}{P}{1}{1}$) is expected to be reduced to $\Delta_{\text{pol}} = \SI{12.4+-1}{\MHz}$. 
Therefore, the signal in $B_{\text{pol}}$ is expected to be about a factor of ${\Delta_{\text{unpol}}}/{\Delta_{\text{pol}}} = \num{1.44+-0.04}$ larger than the signal in $B_{\text{unpol}}$.

Since the the value of ${\Delta_{\text{unpol}}}/{\Delta_{\text{pol}}}$ is close to the value ${\mathcal{S}\pqty*{B_{\text{pol}}}}/{\mathcal{S}\pqty*{B_{\text{unpol}}}}$, this would suggest that the ``enhanced'' signal in the bias magnetic field is due to the Zeeman shift changing the intermediate state detunings instead of due to the Lorentz force guiding more electrons to the MCP.

*** TALK ABOUT WHY WE LOOKED AT RATIOS INSTEAD OF PURE SIGNAL ***

If we examine the ratios of polarized signal to polarized signal (and unpolarized signal to unpolarized signal), we can eliminate common factors.
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathcal{S}_{n}^{\nu=1}}{\mathcal{S}_{n}^{\nu=0}}	=
\end{equation}

The integrated Rydberg molecule signal should scale as
\begin{equation}
	S_{n}^{\nu}	=	\alpha I_{\SI{689}{\nm}} I_{\SI{320}{\nm}} \mathcal{N} \beta_{n} \mathcal{C} \mathcal{F}_{n,\nu}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the detection efficiency, $I_{\SI{689}{\nm}}$ and $I_{\SI{320}{\nm}}$ are the intensities of the $\SI{689}{\nm}$ and $\SI{320}{\nm}$ excitation lasers, $\mathcal{N}$ is a density-dependent term, $\beta_{n}$ is the two-photon transition matrix element, $\mathcal{C}$ is a Clebsch-Gordan factor, and $\mathcal{F}_{n,\nu}$ is the effective Franck-Condon factor.

****************************************

To remove sensitivity to systematics, we examined the ratios of the integral of the {$\nu = 1$ and $2$} ULRRM spectra compared to the $\nu = 0$ state, i.e., $S = \frac{P_{\nu}}{P_{\nu=0}}$.

\subsection{Looking at ${\mathcal{S}^{\nu}_{n,\text{pol}}}/{\mathcal{S}^{\nu}_{n,\text{unpol}}}$}

The work presented in \cite{Whalen2019.PRA.100.011402} demonstrated the sensitivity of the excitation rate of dimer $\nu = 0$ vibrational ground-state ULRRMs to $g^{\pqty*{2}}\pqty*{R}$.
An extension of the work is to explore the effects of quantum statistics on the $\nu > 0$ vibrationally excited states.
As seen in \cref{fig:n34_rydberg_molecule_wave_functions_and_spectra}, the $\nu > 0$ states are delocalized and extend towards smaller $R$ than the $\nu = 0$ state and should make them sensitive more sensitive to $g^{\pqty*{2}}\pqty*{R}$. 
Towards this goal, we explored the excitation rates of the $\nu = 1, 2$ states of ULRRMs in spin-polarized and unpolarized samples of \Sr{87}. 

***** ADD MIDDLE *****

Although the results qualitative agreement between theory and experiment, showing that it is possible to extract information about $g^{\pqty*{0}}\pqty*{R}$ from the $\nu > 0$ vibrational states, it was found that the results are very sensitive to initial wave functions.

\section{Conclusion}

We have measured the photoexcitation rates of the dimer $\nu = 1$ and $\nu = 2$ vibrationally-excited ULRRM states and have shown that they are sensitive to spatial correlations arising from quantum statistics.
In general, there is reasonable agreement between the experimental measurements and theoretical predictions with the spin-polarized data consistently showing weaker excitation compared to the unpolarized gas.
Although weak, there is a small systematic difference between $S_{n} = P_{n,\nu=1,2}/P_{n,\nu=0}$ of the spin-polarized and unpolarized gases.
The presented measurements were very challenging due to long-term drifts in the $\SI{320}{\nm}$ Rydberg laser frequency and to a previously unnoticed beam pointing changes when changing $n$. 
Theoretical calculations are also challenging, as evidenced in \cref{fig:excited_ULRRM_spectra}, where the experimental and theoretical locations of the $\nu = 1$ and $\nu = 2$ ULRRMs lines are slightly shifted.
This suggests that the wave functions of the vibrationally excited state could also be improved.

Knowing these challenges, future work towards stabilizing both the frequency and beam pointing of the Rydberg laser can result in a more accurate spectroscopy.
The updated data can then be passed to theorists so that they can revise the models to more accurately reflect the observed spectra.
Future work should have promising results since it can not only provide a test of theory, but it can also provide a tool for probing spatial correlations on length scales inaccessible with the $\nu = 0$ ULRRM states.
