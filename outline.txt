-Introduction:
	-Motivation.
	-Backstory of the experiment.
		-We originally wanted to do Rydberg dressing. 

-The Rydberg apparatus:
	-Physical apparatus.
		-Vacuum system.
			-Show multiple views.
			-Maybe document various manufacturers/vendors/supplies used for future reference.
		-X-, Y-, Z-trim coils.
			-Show Zeeman shift spectra to determine coil G/V conversion.
	
	-Making cold gases of strontium:
		-Dual MOT oils. 
			-CAD drawing showing how the coils are set up.
			-Some stuff about how the coils were assembled?

		-1st stage cooling: blue MOT:
			-461 nm laser system/layout.
			
		-2nd stage cooling: red MOT:
			-689 nm laser system/layout.
			
		-ODT system:
			-1064 nm laser system/layout.

	-Making and detecting Rydberg atoms.
		-UV laser system.
		-Charged particle detection.
			-Leave most of the details for Joe's thesis.

-689 nm "magic" dimple trap.
	-Idea behind the isotope-dependent optical trapping.
	-Testing with 84Sr.
		-Calculated trap potential.
		-Absorption image of 84Sr BEC with and without dimple.
	-Preliminary results sympathetically cooling 88Sr with 86Sr.
		-Calculated trap potentials.
		-Possibly made dual 88Sr and 86Sr BECs, but not conclusive.

-Spectroscopy of 87Sr triplet Rydberg states.
	-General idea of how the hyperfine shifts are calculated using data from isotopes without hyperfine structure.
		-Hyperfine shifted ionization limits.
	-Experimental method.
		-Two-photon Rydberg excitation and detection scheme.
			-Counterpropagating 689 nm and 320 nm cross-linearly polarized.
