Thesis notes:
-Put in picture of our (fat? at least the most recent one I took) blue MOT.
-Ryan Hanley has a nice Sr energy level diagram.
	-Uses densit-matrix to derive ODT potential (like Martin Boyd (?), Andrew Ludlow(?)).
-Mention how we pick off a 689 nm slave beam to send to the spectrum analyzer.
	-... and how I wouldn't recommend doing it this way since any reflections aren't isolated.
-Ryan Hanley also shows red MOT positional stability before ULE cavity and after.
