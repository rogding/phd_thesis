Getting to the point of writing and defending this dissertation has been a long process\footnote{A paper that captures the thesis writing process quite well \cite{Upper1974.JABA.7.497}.}.
Although my name is on the title page, I by no means could have accomplished any of it on my own. 
Echoing the sentiment expressed in \cite{DeSalvo2015.PhD}, to list everyone who had influenced and helped me along the journey would significantly increase the page count of this thesis. 

I would like to start off by thanking my adviser Dr. F. Barry Dunning and co-adviser Dr. Thomas C. Killian for giving me the opportunity to work on building a new ultracold strontium experiment. 
I still have the email titled ``stop by'' where you took the chance to give an unaffiliated first-year graduate student the opportunity to work on the new experiment you were building after you had found graduate students to fill the vacancies on the other experiments. 
For building the experiment, I couldn't have asked for anyone better than (Dr.) Francisco Camargo and (soon-to-be Dr.) Joe Whalen. 
Handing the Rydberg experiment off to Soumya Kanungo, Haad Rathore, and Yi Lu, I have no doubt that you'll be able to overcome any obstacles you encounter.
I just hope to have left you an experiment that is easy to maintain, modify, and grow to suit whatever you have coming up. 
Although we started graduate school at the same time, I'm proud to have worked alongside (Dr.) Thomas Langin and (Dr.) Jim ``James'' Aman.
--Dr. Shuhei Yoshida who answered all my annoying questions. 

Going to graduate school was never on my radar as an undergraduate until Dr. Joshua Grossman give a freshman at St. Mary's College of Maryland the opportunity to work on a research project for a summer. 
Dr. Grossman not only guided me along but also provided me the freedom to try things (and usually fail) so that I don't fear failure when trying something new. 
He has also been a constant source of guidance in the years since graduating.
I would also like to mention my Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Dr. Daniel Elliott at Purdue University for giving me the opportunity to spend a summer in his lab with his graduate students (at the time)\footnote{Now Dr. John Lorenz, Dr. Adeel Altaf, Dr. Dionysios Antypas, and Dr. Sourav Dutta.} seeing what graduate school is really like. 

Lastly, but most importantly, I would like to thank my father Zuyi Ding as the most important person in my life. 
You singlehandedly raised me from when I was a child and provided everything I could have asked for.
I would never have been able to do any of this without the sacrifices you made and I hope this gives you something to be proud of.
